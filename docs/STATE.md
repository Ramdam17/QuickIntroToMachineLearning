| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current chapter | `02_NaiveBayes` — chapter plan APPROVED (2026-06-18; chapter `01_KNN` COMPLETE via PR #1 `110c081`). |
| Current notebook | `04_estimators_and_parameters` (NB 4 of 5) — **DONE** (both reviewers PASS, Rémy validated & confirmed the count stays 5; committed; merging to chapter). |
| Phase | `notebook-commit` → then open NB 5 (the last) |
| Active branch | `chapter/02_NaiveBayes` (after `notebook/02_NaiveBayes__04_estimators_and_parameters` merges in, ff) |
| Active plan | chapter: `docs/plans/chapter_02_NaiveBayes.md` (APPROVED) |
| Next concrete action | **Open NB 5 — "Text classification" (the demanding case)**, the chapter capstone. `git switch -c notebook/02_NaiveBayes__05_text_classification` off the chapter branch; set STATE (phase `notebook-plan`); **measure** (fetch 20newsgroups subset; `CountVectorizer`+`MultinomialNB` acc; one-vs-rest imbalance; over-confidence/Brier vs LogReg; calibration curve) then plan mode. Per the approved chapter plan: **by-hand vectorization on-ramp** (toy sentences → hand vocab → dense count matrix → reveal `CountVectorizer` + sparsity — built, not "just happening"); fit-on-train-only; **honest eval under imbalance** (one-vs-rest sci.med ≈396 vs 1037 test → precision/recall/F1 + PR curve, not accuracy); **calibration in full** (reliability diagram + Brier — NB over-confident vs LogReg — the limit NB 4 named); the **Domingos-Pazzani loop closes** (independence wildly violated in text, KNN died of the curse, NB fast & strong); **generative-vs-discriminative bridge → ch 03** (Ng & Jordan 2001, named). **Likely `src/` adds (with tests):** `datasets.load_newsgroups()` (fetch-and-cache + visible logging) + `viz.plot_calibration_curve()`. Rémy validates plan alone, then build → both reviewers → Rémy visual → guards → commit → merge → **chapter 02 closes via PR into `main`**. |

## Notes / blockers

- **Resolved (lint debt):** Rémy chose option B — fix the notebooks. NB 01–09 made ruff-clean
  (explicit `zip(strict=False)`, unused `pandas` imports removed, long lines wrapped; all seven
  re-executed end-to-end), committed as `f84eec6`. `ruff check .` is now fully green across the repo.
- NB 01 shipped: `ml_course.datasets.load_penguins()` + vendored `penguins.csv` + tests are in place
  and reusable by later notebooks. pandas-first convention recorded in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.
- Through-line reminder: Palmer penguins (binary, 2 features), nearest-centroid first classifier (NB
  05), polynomial-degree complexity dial (NB 09–10).
- Confirmed: notebooks all-English; maths re-established not presupposed; git history = preserve
  per-notebook, mark chapters (`--no-ff` chapter → main).

## Progress log (most recent first)

- **NB 4 (The estimators & their parameters) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** The
  integration notebook: the NB family (Gaussian/Multinomial/Bernoulli) + each dial *measured* —
  **`var_smoothing`** (flat 0.9927 → 1.0:0.989 → 10:0.711, the flood), **`alpha`/Laplace** healing NB 1's
  penguins zero by hand (α=0→0; α=1→0.0065/post 0.018; verified by-hand == `MultinomialNB.feature_log_prob_`),
  **`priors`/`fit_prior`** tilting the boundary (124↔127 predicted Gentoo; borderline x=[40.8,208] flips
  Adélie→Gentoo at P(Gentoo) 0.15/0.5/0.85), and **honest tuning** (GridSearchCV on train, one sealed
  test). **Calibration named & deferred to NB 5** (penguins too separable, well-calibrated). 20 cells,
  3 figures. Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK): ml-expert REVISE → the asserted Brier 0.0006 reframed as
  a NB-5 forward reference (split-dependent, unshown) + 2 MINORs; pedagogy PASS + 2 MINORs (flip sweep
  aligned to the panels). Rémy questioned whether NB 4 was a 4th concept notebook → confirmed it is the
  role-4 "method & parameters" notebook; chapter stays **5**. `common_errors.md` gained a
  "don't max out smoothing" row; `llms.txt` regenerated; pytest 14. Rémy validated visually.
- **NB 3 (The Gaussian likelihood, computed safely) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** One
  concept (chapter stays 5 — split not pulled): model P(feature∣class) with a continuous **density**,
  computed in **log-space**. Bins (NB 1) were crude → **density first-contact** taught from scratch
  (area not height; integrates to 1; can exceed 1) → per-class **Gaussian** fit (Adélie μ38.79/σ2.65,
  Gentoo μ47.50/σ3.07) overlaid on the density histogram (mass→density; the zero-frequency trap
  dissolves) → **by-hand Gaussian NB = sklearn `GaussianNB` 100 %** (acc 0.9927; curved boundary) →
  likelihood is a choice (multinomial/Bernoulli named → NB 5) → **underflow** (product → 0.0 at N=324)
  → **log-space** (sum of log-likelihoods, argmax unchanged). 20 cells, 4 figures, "Your turn" ×3. Both
  reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK); folded: **3 banned words** ("simply" ×2, "just"), `var_smoothing`
  honesty (by-hand = GaussianNB with smoothing off; scores differ <1e-6 → NB 4 dial), the log-tie
  clause, σ gloss, and a NaN/3rd-species hint on exercise (a). `common_errors.md` gained underflow +
  density-height rows; `llms.txt` regenerated; pytest 14 (no `src/`). Rémy validated visually.
- **NB 2 (The "naive" assumption) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** One concept:
  **conditional independence**. Two features need the joint P(bill,flipper∣species); estimating it
  directly is expensive (5×5 grid, **18/25 cells empty** — curse echo). The naive shortcut: assume
  independence given the class → joint = product of 1-D marginals. **Where it breaks**, measured: real
  vs naive joint heatmaps + a **difference panel** (the discarded correlation), within-class corr
  **0.326/0.661** (vs overall 0.869 = mostly between-class). **Does the decision survive?** CV
  GaussianNB **0.9927** ties LDA, beats QDA **0.9890** (Domingos & Pazzani 1997). Honest: GaussianNB =
  QDA with diagonal covariance; the tie is an accuracy coincidence on near-separable data (NB/LDA
  boundaries differ on 11.5 %, NB/QDA on 18.2 % — verified by ml-expert), *not* a model identity; the
  probabilities suffer even when the decision holds (→ NB 5 calibration). 21 cells, 3 figures, "Your
  turn" ×3. Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK); shared MINOR folded ("Read the table" for the count
  grid). `common_errors.md` gained an overall-vs-within-class-correlation row; `llms.txt` regenerated;
  pytest 14 (no `src/` change). Rémy validated visually.
- **NB 1 (Bayes' rule, from counts) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** By hand on the binary
  penguins subset: the **prior** P(species) 0.551/0.449 by counting → `bill_length` 3-bin contingency
  (Adélie [135,16,0] / Gentoo [3,67,53]) → **likelihood** P(bin∣species) by row-normalizing → **Bayes'
  rule** (4 terms named) → **posterior** P(species∣bin) (short→Adélie 0.978, medium→Gentoo 0.807,
  long→Gentoo 1.000) → predict by **argmax**, with "evidence cancels under argmax" *demonstrated*
  (`joint.idxmax == posterior.idxmax` True). The bin `long` surfaces the **live zero-frequency case**
  (no Adélie → P=0 → posterior exactly 0/1, overconfident) → foreshadows NB 4 smoothing. 21 cells, 3
  figures (prior bar / likelihood grouped bar / posterior stacked bar), "Your turn" ×3, vocabulary box.
  Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK): ml-expert re-derived every number by exact fractions (45/46, 67/83);
  pedagogy confirmed one-concept + voice. 4 MINORs folded (conditional-probability gloss + drop "joint"
  cell 10; discrete-likelihood-normalization hedge cell 12; exhaustivity already in cell 6). Rémy
  validated visually. `common_errors.md` gained a zero-frequency row; `llms.txt` regenerated; pytest 14
  green (no `src/` change).
- **Chapter 02 (Naive Bayes) plan APPROVED & persisted** (`docs/plans/chapter_02_NaiveBayes.md`).
  5 notebooks, standard arc: NB 1 Bayes from counts (one feature, by hand) → NB 2 the naive
  (conditional-independence) assumption → NB 3 the Gaussian likelihood + log-space → NB 4 the
  estimators & parameters (var_smoothing, alpha/zero-frequency, priors, calibration-bridge) → NB 5
  demanding case = **text classification** (20newsgroups, MultinomialNB, honest eval under imbalance,
  the over-confidence limit, generative-vs-discriminative bridge to ch 03). Datasets: penguins (NB 1–4,
  Gaussian) + a 20newsgroups subset (NB 5, fetch-and-cache). Reviewer-gated: **ml-expert REVISE→1 BLOCK
  fixed** (the headline error: GaussianNB is **QDA with diagonal per-class covariance**, *not* LDA — the
  0.9927 NB/LDA/QDA tie is an accuracy coincidence on near-separable 2-D data; re-checked PASS at the
  parameter level), unfair NB(raw)-vs-LogReg(scaled) → both raw, α-curve marked version-indicative.
  **pedagogy REVISE→no BLOCK** (4 MAJORs folded: NB 3 re-scoped to one concept with mass→density as a
  taught first-contact; bag-of-words built by hand in NB 5; NB 4 calibration as a tight bridge; "Your
  turn" per NB). Measured at plan time: within-class corr 0.326/0.661/0.486; NB/QDA/LDA 0.9927/0.9890/
  0.9927; text acc ≈0.89 (4-cat) / ≈0.70 (hard binary); α→0 = log(0) collapse. Next: open NB 1.
- **Chapter 02 (Naive Bayes) opened.** Branch `chapter/02_NaiveBayes` created off `main` (synced to
  `110c081` after PR #1). Phase `chapter-plan`: drafting the chapter plan in plan mode per
  `course_map.md` §02 and the per-method arc. The pending `idle` STATE edit was folded into this
  transition (committed on the chapter branch, not on protected `main`).
- **Chapter 01 (k-Nearest Neighbours) COMPLETE — 6 notebooks merged to `main` via PR #1** (merge commit
  `110c081`, `gh pr merge --merge` — per-notebook history preserved; pushed to
  `Ramdam17/QuickIntroToMachineLearning`). The arc: the vote → distance & the scale trap → the k dial →
  the estimator & its parameters → demanding case + the curse → advanced distances & nested CV. The
  two-reviewer gate (`@ml-expert-reviewer` + `@pedagogy-reviewer`) + Rémy's visual validation held on
  every notebook; NB 6 was rebuilt from scratch (v1 was visually thin). Next: chapter `02_NaiveBayes`.
- **NB 6 (advanced: distances & choosing k) built & merged — chapter complete (6/6).** Optional Advanced
  capstone, **rebuilt from scratch (v1 scrapped by Rémy as too table-heavy)** → visualization-first, 28
  cells, **9 figures**: unit balls L1/L2/L∞; metric decision boundaries on moons; Mahalanobis ellipse +
  Euclidean-vs-Mahalanobis boundary on penguins; distance-concentration histogram (d=2/50/1000);
  near/far ratio by p; accuracy-vs-noise curve (penguins wash vs breast_cancer p=1>p=2, averaged over 8
  draws); nested-CV schematic + fold-score strip (naive 0.967 vs nested 0.960). Both datasets featured;
  silhouette dropped (it concerns k-means cluster count, not k-NN's k). Pedagogy PASS; ml-expert
  REVISE→fixed (L1 unit-ball geometry — vertices on axes, not sides; "staircase"→tendency; LDA→incise).
  Rémy validated. `feat(01_knn): notebook 06 — advanced: distances & choosing k`. **Note:** a stray
  `/tmp/struct.py` shadows stdlib `struct` for `python /tmp/*.py` → build via `uv run python - < file`.
- **NB 5 (demanding case: breast cancer & the curse) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** Full honest
  workflow on `load_breast_cancer` (569×30): pandas look → `Pipeline(StandardScaler, KNN)` (raw CV
  0.935 vs scaled **0.970**, NB 2 scale trap on real data) → CV picks **k=7** → one held-out eval (test
  **0.947**) → error analysis: confusion `[[57,7],[2,105]]`, **malignant recall 0.891 = 7 of 64 cancers
  missed** (accuracy hid it; threshold → NB 8) → when to/not use k-NN → **the curse, felt**: CV acc
  **0.970→0.771** as noise dims grow, near/far ratio **0.121→0.909** (→1, the *why*, Beyer 1999). Curse
  via `cross_val_score` on TRAIN (test stays used-once); near/far = pure geometry. Both reviewers PASS
  (re-derived leak-free, near/far = Beyer's inverse relevant-contrast confirmed; applied MINORs:
  plan-table→CV numbers, curse-is-CV framing + Pipeline-rescales note, asymptotic wording, prereqs
  +06/+08). Rémy validated. `feat(01_knn): notebook 05 — demanding case: breast cancer & the curse`.
  **Build note:** a stray `/tmp/struct.py` (a notebook cell-lister) shadows stdlib `struct` for `python
  /tmp/*.py` (sys.path[0]=/tmp) → run builders via `uv run python - < /tmp/x.py` (stdin) instead.
- **NB 4 (the estimator & its parameters) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** Introduced
  `KNeighborsClassifier`: parity with by-hand (0 diff, 0.956) and `cross_val_score` == NB 3's **0.919**;
  walked `n_neighbors` / `weights` / `metric`. weights uniform vs distance (k=151: 0.678 vs 0.833,
  boundary panels) — **mechanism corrected** after ml review: it is a graded 1/d *tilt* (effective
  ~73/151, nearest-15 hold ~34 %), NOT "near dominates", and 0.833 stays well below uniform@15's 0.956
  (degrades gracefully, doesn't recover). metric small effect (Manhattan p=1 0.967); chose weights by
  `cross_val_score` (distance 0.924 → test 0.967); even-k tie → lowest-label argmax (== by-hand
  `bincount().argmax()` convention) → odd k for binary (binary-only; 3-class can still tie). Pedagogy
  PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed (1 MAJOR: false distance-weight mechanism, re-measured & corrected; +
  MINORs: parity edge-case, argmax convention, figure wording). Rémy validated visually. `feat(01_knn):
  notebook 04 — the estimator & its parameters`.
- **NB 3 (the k dial) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** By-hand k-NN on `make_moons`: k as the
  bias–variance dial — boundaries k=1 (jagged/memorize) / 15 / 151 (over-smooth), contrasted with NB
  05's single bisector; train/test error vs k (log axis, the U; k=1 train err **0.000**); then the
  honest selection — show the test curve, **refuse to use it**, **5-fold CV on TRAIN picks k=15** (cv
  0.919), one sealed test eval → **0.956** (vs k=1 0.933, k=151 0.678). Surfaces (not hides) the
  test-min=k3 vs CV=k15 disagreement. CV by hand (`StratifiedKFold`+loop); `KNeighborsClassifier` /
  `cross_val_score` deferred to NB 4. Both reviewers **PASS** (re-derived CV leak-free; applied 6 fixes:
  variance-inferred-not-measured nod to NB 09, gap *indicates* overfit, CV-fold-seed wobble, odd-k
  explained, boundaries-on-train named, k15/0.956 seed-caveat). Rémy validated visually. `feat(01_knn):
  notebook 03 — the k dial`.
- **NB 2 (distance & the scale trap) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** By-hand k-NN on
  `make_moons`: Euclidean vs Manhattan (a genuine L1/L2 ranking flip — q=(0,0): L2 picks B=(0.7,0.7),
  L1 picks A=(1,0)), then the scale trap — feature 2 ×50 collapses test acc **0.956 → 0.733**,
  standardizing on **train stats** recovers it **exactly** (caveat stated: exact recovery is special to
  a pure rescale); raw-vs-standardized **decision boundary** (horizontal bands slicing the crescents →
  the two-moon S recovered, both PNGs eyeballed). Honest scoping: metric (0.956 vs 0.944 = **one** test
  point of 90) ≪ scale (~20 pts). Tiny in-notebook `ByHandKNN` wrapper reuses
  `viz.plot_decision_boundary` (single split; CV deferred to NB 3). Both reviewers **PASS**
  (re-measured; applied 5 fixes: "34× linear → ~34²≈1000× in the squared sum", metric-gap-is-one-point,
  ISLR §2.2.3 **& ch. 4**, a `ByHandKNN` framing cell naming the fit/predict interface, forced axis
  labels). Rémy validated visually. `feat(01_knn): notebook 02 — distance & the scale trap`.
- **NB 1 (predict by the neighbourhood vote) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** k-NN by hand on
  `make_moons(300, 0.30, 0)` (210/90): the majority vote, *k* = neighbourhood size, and the lazy cost
  **felt live** (fit flat ~µs vs predict super-linear at n=300/3000/30000). At build, the running query
  was **re-measured and corrected**: the planned q=(0.60,0.14) sat on the Bayes boundary (~50/50, so
  "true class 0" was dishonest); replaced with **q=(-0.23,0.75)** — a region only the class-0 crescent
  reaches (~85% class 0 → class 0 is the right answer), nearest training labels [1,0,0,0,0], votes
  k1=1/k3=0/k5=0. Both reviewers **PASS** (each re-measured & confirmed truth/votes/timing; 3 MINOR
  polish applied — NB09 ref → module-00 callback, "nothing learned by fitting", Cover&Hart asymptotic
  1-NN qualifier). Rémy validated visually. `common_errors.md` gained a KNN k=1-noise row; `llms.txt`
  regenerated. Commit `feat(01_knn): notebook 01 — predict by the neighbourhood vote`.
- Chapter 01 (k-NN) plan **approved & persisted** (`docs/plans/chapter_01_KNN.md`) — 6 notebooks: vote
  → distance/scale trap → k-dial → estimator/params → demanding case (breast_cancer + the curse) → an
  optional **NB 6 Advanced** (metric geometry L1/L2/L∞ + Mahalanobis/cosine, metric×curse, nested CV,
  and the silhouette≠k-NN clarification — a deliberate, Rémy-approved exception to the 5-ceiling).
  `make_moons` for NB 1–4 (penguins too separable, measured: 0/69 flips), breast_cancer for NB 5; all
  offline. Reviewer-gated (both REVISE→incorporated). `WORKFLOW.md` updated: chapter close now via PR
  (`main` is protected by a global pre-push hook).
- **Chapter 00 (Getting Started) COMPLETE — 11 notebooks, merged to `main` (`--no-ff`).** The on-ramp:
  what ML is → features/feature space → EDA → split & leakage → nearest centroid → accuracy/baseline →
  confusion/precision-recall → scores/ROC/AUC → over/under-fitting → cross-validation → preprocessing &
  leakage. Plus a fetch-and-cache data layer and a "get your data" step in NB 01. Two-reviewer gate +
  Rémy's visual validation throughout.
- NB 11 (preprocessing & leakage) built — standardization paying off NB 05's scale-sensitivity (NC
  boundary rotates ~52.6° in mm coords; CV 0.989→0.9927), one-hot encoding of `island` (by hand +
  `OneHotEncoder` fit-on-train), `ColumnTransformer`+`Pipeline` under CV, and the ESL §7.10.2 leakage
  demo (1000 pure-noise features: select-on-all 0.85 vs select-in-fold 0.57). Reviewer-gated (pedagogy
  PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed the boundary-rotation angle — my coordinate-space error), Rémy validated.
- NB 01 "Getting the data" step added (Phase 2 of the data-layer change): a fetch+cache section
  (intro md + `load_penguins_full()` with visible `logging` + a "Read the output") inserted after
  "Learning from labelled examples"; teaches fetching/caching as a first ML step, then narrows to the
  2-feature binary slice. Reviewer-gated (ml-expert PASS; pedagogy REVISE→fixed: framed the logging,
  explained the repeated cached-read, trimmed the forward-ref roster, first-run note; +`datasets.py`
  `sex` docstring MALE/FEMALE). Rémy validated visually, merged.
- Data-layer refactor (prereq for NB 11): `datasets.py` switched from a committed binary CSV to
  **fetch-and-cache** the full Palmer penguins set (pinned seaborn-data URL →
  `src/ml_course/data/penguins_full.csv`, git-ignored, offline after first run); added
  `load_penguins_full()` (344×7: +island, sex, bill_depth, body_mass, Chinstrap, missing values) +
  `PENGUINS_FULL_*` constants; `load_penguins()` now **derives** the 2-feature binary subset (verified
  byte-identical to the old committed 274-row CSV → NB 01–10 behaviourally unchanged); removed the
  committed `penguins.csv` + the `.gitignore` exception; repurposed `vendor_penguins.py` to warm the
  cache (logs the download). Tests 14 green; all 10 notebooks re-execute; ruff/black clean. Rémy chose
  fetch-and-cache + a visible fetch step in NB 01 (Phase 2 next). Logging used in `datasets.py` (hook).
- NB 10 (validating honestly: cross-validation) built — single notebook (Rémy chose over a 10a/10b
  split), 30 cells; continues NB 09's make_moons + `flexible_boundary`. Arc: parameters vs
  hyperparameters → the validation set → single-split instability (degree 3,3,5,6,3,9) → stratified
  k-fold BY HAND → CV picks degree 3 → by-hand == `cross_val_score` (0.914286, exact) → one honest
  test estimate (0.9111) → tuning-on-test inflation (+0.014 over 100 splits). No new `src/` (reused
  `plot_train_test_curve`; k-fold scheme + inflation bar in-notebook). Reviewer-gated (pedagogy PASS;
  ml-expert REVISE→ stratification-exactness MAJOR + minors fixed), Rémy validated, merged. Alongside:
  NB 01–09 made ruff-clean (option B, `f84eec6`).
- NB 09 (over-/under-fitting, the generalization gap) built — make_moons + polynomial-degree dial
  (linear engine as plumbing), complexity curve U, generalization gap (≠ variance), bias-variance,
  learning curve, optional variance fan; added `viz.plot_train_test_curve` + test. Reviewer-gated
  (pedagogy PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed the "train error always falls" vs measured kink), Rémy
  validated, merged.
- NB 08 (scores, thresholds, ROC & AUC) built — signed-distance score (`s>0` = centroid), threshold
  trade-off, ROC/AUC 0.989, PR curve, two-feature contrast AUC 1.0; added `viz.plot_roc_curve` +
  `plot_score_threshold` + tests. Reviewer-gated (both PASS; 2 minor polish), Rémy validated, merged.
  Closes the evaluation trilogy (06-08).
- NB 07 (confusion matrix, precision & recall) built — bill-only weaker model for real errors, cm
  [[37,1],[2,29]], precision 0.967 / recall 0.935 / F1 0.951, asymmetric costs. Reviewer-gated (both
  PASS; 3 minor polish), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 06 (accuracy + baseline) built — accuracy formalised, DummyClassifier baseline, the accuracy
  paradox on an imbalanced what-if (Dummy 95%/0-of-2 vs centroid 100%/2-of-2), positive = Gentoo.
  Reviewer-gated (both PASS; 3 minor polish), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 05 (first classifier: nearest centroid) built — by-hand fit/predict class, decision boundary
  (extended `plot_decision_boundary` to be pandas-first + label-agnostic, with a test), honest loop
  (100% test vs 55% baseline, by-hand = sklearn). Reviewer-gated (ml-expert REVISE→fixed, pedagogy
  PASS), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 04 (generalize, don't memorize — stratified split + rote-memorizer demo) built, reviewer-gated
  (both PASS; convergent honesty MINOR fixed), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 03 (look before you model — EDA) built (+ `viz.plot_class_balance` / `plot_feature_histograms`
  + tests), reviewer-gated (both PASS; polish applied), Rémy validated, merged. Also fixed NB 01 c06's
  dangling "fuller dataset" forward-reference (flagged by pedagogy reviewer).
- NB 02 (features, labels, the feature space) built, reviewer-gated (both PASS; 2 minor polish
  applied), Rémy validated visually, committed and merged into `chapter/00_GettingStarted`.
- NB 01 (what is machine learning?) built, reviewer-gated (pedagogy PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed:
  corrected the figure reading, softened the line claim, added subset honesty), Rémy validated
  visually, committed and merged into `chapter/00_GettingStarted`.
- Chapter 00 plan approved and persisted; `course_map.md` 00 section rewritten to 11 notebooks.
- Chapter 00 plan reviewer-gated (both REVISE→incorporated).
- Course scaffold + build workflow set up on `main` (3 infra commits).
