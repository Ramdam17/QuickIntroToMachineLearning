| Current chapter | **`12_NeuralNetworks` — in build (the course finale; 13th & final module). NB 1 shipped (1/10).** Earlier chapters merged to `main`: ch 11 PR #11 (`0ce9d93`), ch 10 PR #10 (`6609afb`), ch 09 PR #9 (`fe295aa`), ch 08 PR #8 (`4775fe2`), ch 07 PR #7 (`b256580`), ch 06 PR #6 (`9f18507`), ch 05 PR #5 (`b5c00f7`). **12/13 modules complete on `main`; this is the last — 10 NBs planned (PyTorch finale).** |
| Current notebook | **`02_depth_is_a_hierarchy`** (NB 2 of 10) — **DONE** (committed + ff-merged to `chapter/12`). 2/10 shipped. |
| Phase | **`notebook-commit` done** — NB 2 committed (`feat(12_neuralnetworks): notebook 02 — depth is a representation hierarchy`) & ff-merged into `chapter/12_NeuralNetworks` (Rémy validated visually; both reviewers no-BLOCK). 2/10 notebooks shipped. **Between notebooks — awaiting Rémy's "go" to open NB 3.** |
| Active branch | **`chapter/12_NeuralNetworks`** (NB 2 merged via ff-only). `notebook/12_NeuralNetworks__02_depth_is_a_hierarchy` is merged (deletable). |
| Active plan | NB 2 DONE (`docs/plans/12_NeuralNetworks__02_depth_is_a_hierarchy.md`). Chapter: `docs/plans/chapter_12_NeuralNetworks.md` (APPROVED). Next: plan NB 3 (vanishing & exploding gradients — the pivot) on Rémy's go. |
| Next concrete action | **Open & plan NB 3 — vanishing & exploding gradients (c02, the pivot) — on Rémy's go.** `git switch chapter/12_NeuralNetworks && git switch -c notebook/12_NeuralNetworks__03_vanishing_exploding_gradients`; phase `notebook-plan`; measure anchors live (run the by-hand backward through a 10-layer stack → per-layer gradient RMS: **sigmoid+small-init collapses ~2.5e-1 → ~1e-16**, **ReLU+unit-Gaussian explodes → ~5e6**; the *training* proof — a 5-layer sigmoid `MLPClassifier` at **0.500** vs tanh/ReLU at **~1.000** on circles) → draft cell-by-cell → ExitPlanMode (Rémy alone, no reviewer gate). **Still pure numpy** (torch arrives at NB 7). **Do NOT auto-start — Rémy initiates with "go".** Build scripts live in the **ephemeral** scratchpad ([[scratchpad-build-scripts-ephemeral]]). |

## Notes / blockers

- **Resolved (NB-4 cycle): ruff debt in ch 08 NB 1–3 fixed** (Rémy: "oui on s'occupe des erreurs"). The 8
  pre-existing errors (`B007` unused loop var; `E501` long lines; `B905` zip-without-strict) are cleared via
  behaviour-preserving edits **in the build scripts** (`for m`→`for _`; wrapped print / `np.array` / `ax.plot`
  / `AdaBoostClassifier(...)` lines; `zip(..., strict=False)`), notebooks rebuilt. `ruff check .` → **All
  checks passed!** (green across the repo); all three re-execute (nbconvert exit 0); the diff is the 8 lines
  only. Committed on `chapter/08_GradientBoosting`.
- **Resolved (lint debt):** Rémy chose option B — fix the notebooks. NB 01–09 made ruff-clean
  (explicit `zip(strict=False)`, unused `pandas` imports removed, long lines wrapped; all seven
  re-executed end-to-end), committed as `f84eec6`. `ruff check .` is now fully green across the repo.
- NB 01 shipped: `ml_course.datasets.load_penguins()` + vendored `penguins.csv` + tests are in place
  and reusable by later notebooks. pandas-first convention recorded in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.
- Through-line reminder: Palmer penguins (binary, 2 features), nearest-centroid first classifier (NB
  05), polynomial-degree complexity dial (NB 09–10).
- Confirmed: notebooks all-English; maths re-established not presupposed; git history = preserve
  per-notebook, mark chapters (`--no-ff` chapter → main).
- **Build gotcha (editor kernel-drift):** opening a notebook in the VS Code Jupyter editor rewrites its
  kernelspec `display_name` to `ml-course (3.12.12.final.0)` — cosmetic (the kernel resolves by
  `name: "python3"`), but it drifted NB 3's committed metadata once (normalized in `c493293`). **Habit:
  rebuild each notebook from its build script right before `git add`** (after Rémy's visual validation)
  so the canonical `ml-course (3.12.12)` ships; or `git restore` the file if only the display_name drifted.

## Progress log (most recent first)

- **NB 2 (depth is a representation hierarchy — c01) OPENED.** Branch
  `notebook/12_NeuralNetworks__02_depth_is_a_hierarchy` off `chapter/12_NeuralNetworks` (@ `9fffa02`). Phase
  `notebook-plan`: measuring anchors live, then drafting the cell-by-cell plan. **One concept (chapter plan
  §NB 2):** *why* stack layers — successive layers **compose / remap** features; depth (not just width) is the
  bet. By hand (pure numpy): stack the NB-1 forward pass into an `L`-layer net; show what successive hidden
  layers represent on a 2-D problem (the **layer-by-layer activation remap**); show — **honestly, measured** —
  that depth helps modestly (MNIST-10k `(50,)` ~0.941 → `(256,128,64)` ~0.949). **Drop the equal-unit-budget
  claim** (the anchor compares 50 vs 448 units) → land on "depth remaps the feature space; a modest, honest
  gain"; *optional* equal-budget `(448,)` vs `(256,128,64)` near-wash check (itself the honest lesson).
  *Honesty:* the vivid edge→part→object hierarchy is a **CNN** phenomenon (c09, NB 10 horizon) — NB 2 shows
  the honest version and defers the vivid picture. Figs: layer-by-layer activation remap; depth-vs-accuracy
  (honest, modest). **Still pure numpy — no torch** (the `deep` extra + torch land at NB 7). NB-plan = **Rémy
  validates alone** (no reviewer gate; both reviewers return on the built notebook). **Anchors measured live**
  (`measure_ch12_nb2_remap.py` / `_depth.py` / `_equalbudget.py` / `_init.py`): moons `[2,2,2,1]` linsep
  **0.877→0.917→0.973**, net acc ~0.96 (5 seeds 0.958–0.963); **MNIST 10k/5k 50u 0.9432 / 448u-wide 0.9538 /
  deep(256,128,64) 0.9558** (width +1.1pp; **equal-budget depth +0.2pp — near-wash**, robust +0.002–0.004/seed
  at 60 ep, both train 1.0); sklearn cross-check 0.940/0.9486/0.9490; **flat-0.1 init (NB-1's) trains every net
  → no He forward-ref**; `[2,8,1]` width alone untangles moons (~0.965); `[2,2,2,2,1]` deeper net sometimes
  stalls (seed0 0.887 — NB-3 foreshadow). **Plan APPROVED by Rémy via ExitPlanMode (no edits) & persisted**
  (`docs/plans/12_NeuralNetworks__02_depth_is_a_hierarchy.md`). **BUILT (22 cells: 7 code / 15 md, 3 figures;
  pure numpy) — awaiting Rémy's visual validation.** Unified machinery (NB-1's softmax+CE generalized to an
  `L`-layer loop; hidden act a choice tanh/ReLU; flat-0.1 init — **no He forward-ref**). **Anchors reproduced
  (nbconvert exit 0, 3 figures):** gradient-check **1.45e-7**; moons `[2,2,2,2]` (tanh, lr0.5, 8000 ep) loss
  ln2(0.693)→0.089, acc **0.965**; one wide layer `[2,8,2]` **0.965**; MNIST 10k/5k (ReLU, flat-0.1, 60 ep)
  **50u 0.9432 / 448u-wide 0.9538 / deep(256,128,64) 0.9558** (width +1.06pp; equal-budget depth +0.20pp,
  near-wash). **Both reviewers no-BLOCK** — `@pedagogy-reviewer` **PASS** (one-concept arc, no forward refs,
  3 Read-the-figure match the pixels, exemplary equal-budget control) + 2 NIT folded (named the mini-batch loop
  in cell 5; fixed "NB-1's single sigmoid" → "a sigmoid of ch 11" in cell 7); `@ml-expert-reviewer` **REVISE→
  no-BLOCK** — verified every anchor live, **MAJOR folded:** the linsep staircase used the **default
  regularized** `LogisticRegression` probe (understated h1 ~5pp → false "rises step by step"); switched to a
  near-unregularized probe (`C=1e6`) → honest **input 0.877 → h1 0.970 → h2 0.970** ("the **first** layer does
  almost all the untangling; the second consolidates" — strengthens the anti-hype thesis, ties to the wide-layer
  + MNIST near-wash) + 2 MINOR (gradient-check message softened to "finite-difference precision"; float-order
  "about" confirmed sufficient). Removed an extra "clearly" (cell 21, ml-expert-adjacent). Guards: ruff *All
  checks passed*, hex clean, **banned 0**, output-free; black skips `.ipynb` (no `black[jupyter]`, as NB 1).
  **Rémy validated visually (2026-06-30). End-of-NB checklist done:** rebuilt from `build_ch12_nb2.py`
  (kernel-drift guard), `llms.txt` **89**, `course_map` §12 → **NB 1–2 built**, `common_errors` **+2 rows**
  (deep-net-remaps-into-linear-separability-not-a-wiggly-boundary; deeper-isn't-always-better / equal-budget
  near-wash / vivid-hierarchy-needs-a-CNN), **pytest 20** (no `src/` change). **No `src/` change** (notebook-local
  numpy `L`-layer net; sklearn utilities `make_moons`/`fetch_openml`/`train_test_split`/`StandardScaler` +
  `LogisticRegression` as a linsep probe; `viz`/`colors`; inline matplotlib). **COMMITTED & ff-merged into
  `chapter/12`.** Next: open & plan NB 3 (vanishing & exploding gradients — the pivot) on Rémy's go.
- **NB 1 (a neural network from scratch in numpy — the hello-world / reference) OPENED.** Branch
  `notebook/12_NeuralNetworks__01_numpy_hello_world` off `chapter/12_NeuralNetworks` (@ `d009480`). Phase
  `notebook-plan`: measuring anchors live (a by-hand multi-class **softmax + cross-entropy** net on
  `make_blobs` 3-class — gradient-check the softmax-CE gradient vs finite differences; train via GD), then
  drafting the cell-by-cell plan. **NB-1 pins (approved chapter plan):** the reference net is multi-class
  softmax+CE on a 2-D `make_blobs` 3-class toy; the binary chain-rule backward is **ch-11-NB-3 recap
  (black-boxed, NOT re-derived)**; the **softmax-CE gradient is the one genuinely-new derivation**; it is the
  **same architecture NB 7 re-instantiates in torch**; **show** (never assign) the full machinery — forward /
  loss / backward / short GD loop / train-test / eval / optimizer. **Pure numpy — no torch** (the `deep`
  extra + torch land at NB 7). NB-plan = **Rémy validates alone** (no reviewer gate; both reviewers return on
  the built notebook). **Plan APPROVED & persisted.** **BUILT (25 cells: 7 code / 18 md, 4 figures; pure
  numpy) & ff-merged into `chapter/12` — Rémy validated visually.** Anchors reproduced (nbconvert exit 0):
  untrained loss **1.1012 ≈ ln3**; softmax-CE **gradient-check 5.28e-8**; loss **1.10→0.31**; **train 0.867
  / test 0.893** (chance 0.333). **Both reviewers PASS, no BLOCK** — `@ml-expert` re-verified every anchor
  live and derived the softmax-CE gradient from first principles (rel-err **2.4e-10**, exact); `@pedagogy`
  found no concept gap and a clean recap/new boundary. **Folds (markdown only):** added a *Going further*
  derivation of `(p−y)` (the softmax Jacobian and the `1/p_c` cancel); re-anchored the generalization
  verdict on the **gap-to-chance** (not the noisy 75-pt train/test ordering — the ch-11-NB-5 lesson);
  bridged the schematic (5 units drawn → `W₁` is (2×16)). Guards: ruff / hex / banned 0 / output-free;
  **pytest 20** (no `src/` change); `llms.txt` **88**; `course_map` §12 → NB 1 built; `common_errors`
  **+2 rows** (softmax-CE-gradient-is-(p−y); untrained-loss-is-lnK). Next: open & plan NB 2 (depth) on
  Rémy's go.
- **CHAPTER 12 (NeuralNetworks) OPENED — the course finale (13th & final module).** Chapter 11 (MLP)
  closed via PR #11 (merge `0ce9d93`; 5 NBs, per-notebook history preserved). Branch
  `chapter/12_NeuralNetworks` created off `main` (@ `0ce9d93`). Phase `chapter-plan`: concept tour
  (`@concept-cartographer`, neural-networks scope) → draft the 5-NB chapter plan per `course_map.md`
  §12 and the per-method arc → **two-reviewer gate** (`@ml-expert-reviewer` + `@pedagogy-reviewer`, no
  BLOCK) → Rémy approves via ExitPlanMode. The deferred ch-11-close housekeeping (`course_map` §11 →
  "merged via PR #11") is folded into this opening commit (on the chapter branch, not protected
  `main`). **The key planning decision is the ch 11 / ch 12 scope boundary:** ch 11 already built the
  hidden layer, backprop by hand, ReLU, the K-class softmax head, mandatory scaling, and the loss
  curve — so ch 12 must teach the genuinely-new deep-learning material (depth as a representation
  *hierarchy*; dropout; depth-driven gradient pathologies — vanishing/exploding; modern init /
  normalization; the deep-learning-framework move) without repeating ch 11 or overloading. **`src/` WILL change** (the `deep` extra + a Fashion-MNIST loader + tests → pytest rises
  from 20 at the NB-7/NB-9 builds). **Concept tour DONE** (full map c01–c11 + dependency graph + live
  anchors + verified offline datasets + refs); the cartographer **recommended A (stay sklearn)**, but
  **Rémy chose B (PyTorch) with eyes open** for a faithful finale; structural direction = **~10 thicker
  NBs**, two hello-worlds (numpy NB 1 / torch NB 7), torch **shown not hand-coded** (skorch dropped).
  **Chapter plan drafted → two-reviewer gate (both REVISE→no-BLOCK; the ml-expert live-verified every
  sklearn anchor and measured the capstone-foil fix — Fashion-MNIST MLP 0.859 ≈ RF 0.853 < HistGB 0.874,
  a tree genuinely wins) → APPROVED by Rémy via ExitPlanMode (2026-06-29) & persisted**
  (`docs/plans/chapter_12_NeuralNetworks.md`); `course_map` §12 refined to the 10-NB decomposition.
  Next: open & plan NB 1 (numpy hello-world) on Rémy's go.
- **NB 5 (the demanding case — handwritten digits, the visualization-first capstone) OPENED.** Branch
  `notebook/11_MLP__05_digits_capstone` off `chapter/11_MLP` (@ `9b1394d`). Phase `notebook-plan`: measuring
  anchors live, then drafting the capstone. **The LAST NB of ch 11.** Scope (chapter plan §NB 5): a full,
  honest, multi-class workflow on **`load_digits`** (8×8, 1797×64, 10-class, offline, CPU-fast).
  `Pipeline(StandardScaler, MLPClassifier)`; tune lightly; held-out eval; read the **loss curve**; **confusion
  matrix + per-digit error analysis**; **seed-variance** check (single split → init variance ~0.974–0.980); a
  **fair tree-foil** — RF/HistGB on **raw** features (trees need no scaling) vs the MLP in its
  `StandardScaler` pipeline, same split/metric — *the preprocessing difference is the point*. **Honest verdict
  (measured):** MLP **fully competitive, NOT superior** (HistGB ~0.982 ≥ MLP; RF ~0.970, logistic ~0.972) —
  earns "learned features" as a *conceptual* virtue (ch 12 bridge), but trees need no scaling + stay
  interpretable; loss **non-convex** (a minimum, not *the*); **seed-sensitive**; UAT = existence. The genuine
  MLP accuracy win lives **elsewhere** (`breast_cancer` 0.9754 > RF 0.9649 / HistGB 0.9701 — the measured
  "MLP can win" fact). Arc (**≥6 figures, ~28–30 cells, visualization-first**): look at the digits → baseline
  → scaled MLP + loss curve → held-out metrics (confusion, per-class) → seed-variance → fair tree foil +
  honest limit → error gallery (which digits confuse). No `src/` change expected (reuse `viz`/`colors`;
  `load_digits`/`load_breast_cancer`; `MLPClassifier` + `Pipeline` + `StandardScaler`; RF/HistGB; pytest 20).
  NB-plan = **Rémy validates alone** (no reviewer gate; both reviewers return on the built notebook).
  **After it ships, close chapter 11 via PR `chapter/11_MLP → main` (`--no-ff`) on Rémy's explicit go.**
  **Plan APPROVED by Rémy via ExitPlanMode (2026-06-29) & persisted** (`docs/plans/11_MLP__05_digits_capstone.md`),
  with **two measured refinements approved** — (1) the digits cross-method is a **statistical TIE** (5-fold CV:
  MLP 0.9772±0.007 ≈ RF 0.9766±0.004 ≈ HistGB 0.9733±0.006), NOT the chapter-plan "HistGB ~0.982 ≥ MLP, RF
  ~0.970" (a single sealed split gave RF 0.984/MLP 0.978/HistGB 0.973 — split-luck); (2) the fair foil uses
  **5-fold CV** (not the noisy single split) while the MLP diagnostics stay on the sealed split. Anchors
  measured live (`measure_ch11_nb5.py`): baselines dummy 0.102 / logistic 0.969 / tree 0.856; scaled MLP(100,)
  sealed **0.9778** / n_iter 145 / loss 2.52→0.005; seed-variance (10 seeds) **0.971–0.982** mean 0.977;
  confusion **10 errors/450** (9→3, 8→3/1…); GridSearchCV picks the default (tuned==default 0.9778);
  breast_cancer CV MLP **0.9754** > RF 0.9631 / HistGB 0.9648. Next: build NB 5 from `build_ch11_nb5.py`.

  BLOCK** — `@ml-expert-reviewer` PASS (reproduced every anchor; ran unshown **paired t-tests** confirming the
  digits tie p≈0.49/0.92 and breast_cancer "a touch ahead" p=0.53; leakage-free paired CV; CV-over-single-split

  `notebook/11_MLP__04_estimator_and_parameters` off `chapter/11_MLP` (@ `9ee1f9e`). Phase `notebook-plan`:
  measuring anchors live, then drafting the cell-by-cell plan. **Integrative (chapter plan §NB 4):** each knob
  from the concept that owns it — `hidden_layer_sizes` (depth×width = capacity); **`activation` — why ReLU is
  the default (no saturation); the measured sigmoid+adam stall from NB 2/3 is the concrete motivation**
  (depth-driven vanishing gradient deferred to ch 12); `solver` (sgd/adam/lbfgs — **Adam named** as "an
  adaptive-step upgrade of the GD you built"); `alpha` (L2); `learning_rate_init`;
  `early_stopping`+`validation_fraction`; `max_iter`; **`batch_size` — epoch / mini-batch / iteration
  introduced as vocabulary** (their genuine home; the loss-curve x-axis). **The K-class softmax output head —
  its explicit home** (turn the single sigmoid output into K softmax units; formula recap from ch 03 NB 5; one
  schematic + Read-the-figure). **Scaling mandatory**; the **loss curve** (`loss_curve_`) as the convergence
  diagnostic (reading recapped from ch 03 NB 4 fig (c)). Honest spine: unscaled-vs-scaled on a **synthetic
  2-feature mismatched-scale problem** (digits too homogeneous to break reliably — folded ml-expert MAJOR); a
  capacity sweep (width/depth) reading boundary + loss curve; `alpha` up/down; defaults-vs-`GridSearchCV` →
  **one sealed test**. `ConvergenceWarning` stays **visible**; `verbose=True` where per-iteration loss aids the
  lesson — never `verbose=False`-as-suppression. ~4 figures. No `src/` change expected (reuse `viz`/`colors`;
  `MLPClassifier` + `Pipeline` + `StandardScaler`; `make_classification`/`make_blobs`/`make_circles`/

  anchors live, then drafting the cell-by-cell plan. **One concept (chapter plan §NB 3):** backprop = the
  **chain rule applied layer by layer** — the forward pass **caches** activations, the backward pass carries
  the error back (`d_out`; `dH = d_out @ W2.T * H·(1−H)` for a sigmoid hidden layer; then `dW1`, `dW2`); the
  optimizer is **ch 03's GD loop, now multi-layer**; **init must not be zeros** (symmetry breaking). By hand
  on a `2-H-1` net: forward+backward, **gradient-check vs finite differences (rel_err ~2e-9)**, run full-batch
  GD, **demonstrate the zeros-init collapse**. The general L-layer algorithm as a **picture**, not a
  multi-index grind. Anchor: by-hand **2-4-1** sigmoid net trained by GD → **train acc 1.0 on circles**,
  matching `MLPClassifier((4,),'logistic','lbfgs')`; zeros-init — full zeros → all gradients **0** (frozen),
  W1=0/W2≠0 → identical-nonzero columns, random init breaks it. ~3 figures (forward-cache → backward-error

  `MLPClassifier((4,),'logistic','lbfgs')` lands **0.85–1.0 / 0.76–1.0** (rs=0 **0.98/0.95**) — the
  non-convexity the chapter flags; (2) the **symmetry sub-claim corrected** — W1=0/W2≠0 actually *breaks*
  symmetry (col-spread 0→3.37, acc 1.0), so the frozen/stuck demos are **full-zeros** (`|grad|=0`, loss
  ln2=0.6931, acc 0.50) + **fully-symmetric units** (identical W1 cols + W2 → col-spread 0→0, acc 0.68) vs

  `notebook-plan`: measuring parity anchors live, then drafting the cell-by-cell plan. **One concept
  (chapter plan §NB 3):** partitioning K categories into two groups is `2^(K−1)−1` ways (exponential);
  Fisher (1958) — for the convex structure-score gain `G²/(H+λ)` (ch 09 NB 2) — the optimal binary
  partition is **contiguous** once categories are sorted by their gradient statistic `G/H`, so only
  `K−1` candidates (linear). Build by hand on a binary toy: per-category `(G,H)`, sort by `G/H`, score
  the `K−1` contiguous splits, take the max → the category set going left; **match LightGBM exactly**
  (de-risked at the restructure: LEFT {1,3,5} ≡ LightGBM {0,2,4}) and brute-force-confirm it is the global
  optimum (vs all `2^(K−1)−1`). Genuinely new vs ch 09 (which *used* native categoricals but never built
  the split); contrast XGBoost's partition heuristic. **Build-time pins:** `min_data_per_group=1` (default
  100 breaks parity on a small toy), `min_data_in_leaf=1, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=0, cat_l2=0, cat_smooth=0`
  — OR ≥100 rows/category. **Teaching note:** with `h=1` (regression toy) `G/H` = the per-category target
  mean; give `G/H` as the general key (carries to classification). Keep the toy **binary**. No `src/` change
  expected (reuse `viz`; `LGBMRegressor` + `dump_model`; pytest 20). **Plan APPROVED by Rémy (via

  `notebook/10_LightGBM__02_goss_efb` off `chapter/10_LightGBM` (@ `fed6560`). Phase `notebook-plan`:
  measuring GOSS anchors live, then drafting the cell-by-cell plan. **Scope (chapter plan §NB 2):** one
  built concept — **GOSS** (Gradient-based One-Side Sampling, Ke et al. 2017 §3.2) — + one named companion
  — **EFB** (Exclusive Feature Bundling, §4). Name the ch 09 NB 2 anchor: the split-gain is a **sum over
  rows** of `g,h`. GOSS: rank rows by `|gradient|`, keep the top `a`, sample `b` of the rest, **up-weight
  the sampled rest by `(1−a)/b`** so `G,H` stay ~unbiased (`H` exactly: `a·n + (1−a)/b · b·n = n`). The
  discriminating story: large-`|g|` rows are kept **exactly** (zero sampling variance) → the GOSS
  gain-estimate is **lower-variance** than a uniform subsample at the same fraction `a+b`, both ~centred on
  the full-data gain; this translates to **GOSS ≈ full-data held-out quality & beating a uniform subsample
  at matched fraction** (LightGBM ensemble). **Honesty bar:** GOSS's wall-clock benefit is
  **regime-dependent (~flat on dense moderate data — measured; bites on very large/wide data)**; the gain
  is `G²/(H+λ)`, a *function* of the row-sums, so it is *approximately* (not exactly) unbiased — GOSS lowers
  its **variance**, the honest claim (Ke Thm 3.2). EFB named (approximately-exclusive sparse features,
  tolerates a small conflict rate — more than concatenating one-hot columns). No `src/` change expected
  (reuse `viz`; `LGBMClassifier` `data_sample_strategy='goss'` / `bagging_fraction` for the uniform foil;

  signed off):** the chapter-plan wording "GOSS beats a uniform subsample at matched fraction" proved
  **regime-dependent** — GOSS's variance edge over uniform is gated by **gradient concentration**
  (crossover ≈ 0.5; synthetic sweep GOSS/uniform std ratio 1.64/1.24/0.99/0.64/0.27 at conc
  0.20/0.36/0.49/0.67/0.86). On **moderate dense tabular data** concentration stays **0.21→0.47** even at
  200 boosting rounds (≤ crossover) → GOSS **≈ full quality on 30 % rows** (ensemble 0.9345 vs full 0.9313)
  but **~ties** uniform there; GOSS's real win is the large/wide/sparse concentrated regime (→ NB 5). Both
  unbiased (`H` exact `a·n+(1−a)/b·b·n=n`; `G` unbiased); the lever is **variance, only when gradients are
  imbalanced** (Ke et al. Thm 3.2). Wall-clock ~flat on dense (2.41 vs 2.45 s). NB teaches this honest
  version (a strict upgrade, consistent with the chapter's "GOSS = statistical efficiency, wall-clock
  regime-dependent" bar). **BUILT (23 cells: 8 code / 15 md, 4 figures) & MERGED to `chapter/10_LightGBM`

  **NB 3 the optimal categorical split (NEW — built by hand, Fisher 1958: sort categories by `G/H`, best

  estimator (`num_leaves`/`min_child_samples` *tuned* here, closing NB 1's lopsided→overfit loop) · NB 5
  capstone. `num_leaves` standalone NB dropped → budget in NB 1 + dial in NB 4. All three fundamentals now
  **build a mechanism by hand** (leaf-wise · GOSS · categorical split). Re-gate folds: ml-expert (pin
  `min_data_per_group=1` for NB-3 parity; `G/H`↔mean note; structure-score criterion; toy binary);
  pedagogy (NB 1 had **5** forward-ref seams not 3 — repointed: overfit→NB 4, "Next"→NB 2 GOSS; NB 4 must

  `notebook-plan`: measuring anchors live then drafting the cell-by-cell plan — one concept, **build
  leaf-wise (best-first) tree growth by hand** (a frontier of candidate leaves; repeatedly expand the
  one whose best split gives the largest loss reduction, to a `num_leaves` budget) and contrast with
  level-wise (ch 04/09 depthwise). Leaf-wise was *named* twice before (ch 08 NB 5 HistGBR
  `max_leaf_nodes`; ch 09 NB 4 `lossguide`) — **here built**. Anchor: by-hand leaf-wise == LightGBM's
  single tree on a toy; leaf-wise reaches lower **training** loss for the same #leaves, grows lopsided
  (qualitative; the depth-vs-num_leaves sweep is NB 2). No `src/` change expected (reuse `viz`;

  SSE 0.566==0.566). **BUILT (17 cells, 3 figures) & REVIEWED — both NO BLOCK, awaiting Rémy visual.**
  Each reviewer raised one MAJOR → folded: ml-expert caught a real bug — my `grow('level')` descended the
  left spine **depth-first** instead of breadth-first → rewrote it as a true FIFO (corrected level-wise
  curve 268→65@4 leaves→12@8; leaf-wise still wins at every budget — 6 leaves 0.57 vs 65.4); pedagogy
  caught Fig-2 subplot titles colliding → moved leaf sizes to a print + short titles + `tight_layout`.
  MINOR/NIT folded: named `LAMBDA=0.0`; one line that the leaf value `mean(y)` = `F0 + (−G/H)`; FIFO
  wording. Parity unchanged (leaf-wise logic untouched). Guards: ruff clean, 0 banned, output-free, hex

  the per-method arc — **leaf-wise vs level-wise growth** (the XGBoost contrast; ch 09 NB 4 named
  `grow_policy=lossguide` as this bridge); histogram binning + **`num_leaves`** as the central dial;
  categorical handling & the overfitting traps; tuning / early stopping vs XGBoost; a demanding case on
  larger tabular data (speed/accuracy measured). LightGBM 4.6.0 lives in the `boosting` extra (+
  `libomp`); confirm the live API/behaviour before pinning anchors. Chapter plan is reviewer-gated (both
  reviewers, no BLOCK) before Rémy approves. The pending ch-09-close edits (STATE → idle + `course_map`
  §09 → "merged via PR #9") are folded into this opening commit (committed on the chapter branch, not on
  protected `main`). **Plan APPROVED by Rémy (via ExitPlanMode + the two-reviewer gate, 2026-06-28) &
  persisted** (`docs/plans/chapter_10_LightGBM.md`); both reviewers **REVISE → no BLOCK**, folded: the
  speed thesis → **matched-capacity both directions** (the winner flips with the convention; not "XGBoost
  faster"); GOSS → **statistical efficiency** (wall-clock regime-dependent, ~flat on dense data, measured);
  the **HistGBR-is-already-leaf-wise gift** (it defaults `max_leaf_nodes=31` = LightGBM's `num_leaves=31`)
  → used in the spine + as NB 5's matched sibling; NB 3 = "one built (GOSS) + one named (EFB)". Live
  anchors measured (num_leaves 31 / max_depth −1; num_leaves 127 → depth 15; GOSS API; categorical;
  early-stopping callbacks; speed/accuracy). `course_map` §10 refined to the 5-NB decomposition. Next:
  open & plan NB 1 (leaf-wise growth, by hand).

  **Five notebooks:** the second-order view (`w*=−G/H` unifies ch 08's two leaf rules) · the regularized
  objective (λ/γ, the structure-score gain, `Cover=Σh`, the measured 2×/½ convention) · sparsity-aware
  splits (a learned default direction for NaN) · the estimator & its parameters (each knob from its
  concept; **owns the histogram method**, ~5× faster at no accuracy cost; defaults overfit → honest
  tuning) · the Census-income capstone (8 figures: imbalance/PR-AUC, the **honest native-vs-imputed
  null**, cross-method, early stopping, validation-chosen threshold, MDI-vs-permutation, ethics /
  do-not-deploy). The **regularized, second-order, engineered refinement** of ch 08's engine — **not a
  new algorithm**, and **no universal best** (edges = speed / native missing+categorical handling /
  regularization, not accuracy). Two-reviewer gate (no BLOCK) + Rémy visual on every NB; every number
  measured live (xgboost 3.2.0 / lightgbm 4.6.0), seed-pinned; honest findings throughout (the 2×/½ gain
  convention; defaults memorize but L2-on is about calibration not accuracy; native-NaN ≈ imputed when
  missingness is redundant; convenience ≠ power; MDI-vs-permutation divergence). **No `src/` change**
  across the chapter (reused `viz`; `trees_to_dataframe`; `fetch_openml`; sklearn Pipelines) — pytest
  stays **20**. `main` synced @ `fe295aa`, ruff green, pytest 20, `llms.txt` 74. Env: `boosting` extra +

  measuring anchors live then drafting the capstone (~26 cells, ≥6 figures). The chapter's **capstone** —
  a full, honest tabular workflow mobilizing all of ch 09. **Verification owed at plan time** (chapter
  plan): does Adult's missingness actually move PR-AUC under native-NaN-vs-imputed, and is `?`→NaN; if
  the lever is negligible, lean the NB-3 callback on categorical native handling or fall back to Ames
  (rename branch). Arc: measured missingness-vs-target panel → baselines → tuned XGBoost with **early
  stopping** (`eval_set`) → held-out acc/precision/recall/PR-AUC + threshold → error analysis → honest
  cross-method comparison (XGB/GB/HistGBR/RF/linear, **native-NaN-vs-imputed a named axis**, XGB run both
  ways) → gain-MDI vs permutation → LightGBM teaser. **Last NB of ch 09 — after it ships, close the

  native-NaN-vs-imputed is **within noise** (Δ −0.001) because the informative missingness is redundant
  with correlated features → Rémy chose to **keep Adult and feature the honest null** ("measure the

  `notebook-plan`: drafting the cell-by-cell plan — one concept, put complexity **into the objective**
  `Obj = Σ loss + Ω(f)`, `Ω = γT + ½λΣw²`. Two consequences, both by hand: the leaf weight becomes
  `w* = −G/(H+λ)` (L2 shrinks it toward 0), and the **split gain** derived from the structure score
  (C&G eq. 6 → 7) `½[G_L²/(H_L+λ)+G_R²/(H_R+λ)−G²/(H+λ)] − γ` decides whether to split (γ = pre-pruning).
  The correctness anchor: by-hand leaf weights == XGBoost exactly, and the **measured 2×/½** detail
  (XGBoost reports 2× the textbook gain, dropping the ½ — argmax-invariant); `Cover = ΣH`; `base_score`
  honest (learned when unpinned). Anchors measured at plan time (xgboost 3.2.0). No `src/` change

  **Env fixed & measured live:** `uv sync --extra dev --extra boosting` (xgboost 3.2.0 / lightgbm 4.6.0)

  weights exact, gain 2× textbook, `Cover`=ΣH), the resolved defaults, NaN across GB/HistGBR/XGBoost,
  native categoricals, the early-stopping API, and Adult's informative missingness. All MAJOR/MINOR folded

- **Chapter 09 (XGBoost) opened.** Branch `chapter/09_XGBoost` created off `main` (synced @ `4775fe2`
  after PR #8). Phase `chapter-plan`: drafting the chapter plan in plan mode per `course_map.md` §09 and
  the per-method arc — what XGBoost **adds** to gradient boosting (the regularized objective + the
  second-order / Newton view) → missing-value & sparsity handling + the histogram split → the key knobs
  (`eta`, `max_depth`, `subsample`, `colsample_*`, `lambda`/`alpha`) → early stopping & overfitting
  control → a demanding case tuning honestly vs the simpler boosters. Builds directly on ch 08's gradient
  boosting (XGBoost = a regularized, second-order, engineered refinement of the same engine); ch 10
  LightGBM is the sibling. `xgboost` lives in the `boosting` extra — confirm the live install/version
  before pinning any anchors. The pending `idle` STATE edit + `course_map.md` §08 → complete were folded
  into this opening commit (committed on the chapter branch, not on protected `main`).
- **CHAPTER 08 (Gradient Boosting) COMPLETE — merged to `main` via PR #8** (merge commit `4775fe2`,
  `gh pr merge --merge`; per-notebook history preserved; pushed to Ramdam17/QuickIntroToMachineLearning).
  **Six notebooks:** residuals by hand (regression) · the residual *was* the gradient · classification
  (Newton leaf; exp-loss = AdaBoost) · shrinkage & the trees (overfit-at-large-ν; RF contrast) · the
  estimator & early stopping · the California-housing capstone — plus a `style` commit making NB 1–3
  ruff-clean. The **general form** of boosting (AdaBoost = the exp-loss special case); the course's **first

  predictor; overfit ν-dependent; OOB noisier than held-out; the dramatic MDI-vs-permutation location
  divergence + the censored $500k cap). NB 6's capstone took a **revise round** (ml-expert BLOCK on the cap

  `GradientBoosting{Regressor,Classifier}` & its parameters (subsample/OOB, early stopping, importances;
  `HistGradientBoosting*` named) → NB 6 demanding case **California housing** (regression capstone,
  visualization-first). The **general form** of boosting (AdaBoost = the exponential-loss special case);
  the bridge ch 07 promised. Reviewer-gated on the live install (sklearn 1.9.0): **pedagogy PASS** (six
  NBs earned; regression-first honest, a coherent journey not whiplash — spine = "the loss is the dial";
  4 MINOR + 1 NIT noted for the NB-plan gates); **ml-expert REVISE → folded** — MAJOR: "reproduces
  AdaBoost" softened to **objective-level only** (GB `loss='exponential'` shares AdaBoost's loss but
  ~95% prediction agreement, identical test acc 0.9417, **not** bit-identical); MAJOR: NB 3 anchors
  re-pinned (moons-0.20 is balanced → round-1 residuals **±0.5000** not ±0.507; the Newton-vs-mean
  log-loss gap is **config-dependent** → ship the *direction* + the machine-precision Newton match, pin
  the config & re-measure at build); MINORs: overfit qualified to **large ν** with the mechanistic RF
  contrast, the **regression-tree-leaf=mean** rule re-laid in NB 1 as the hinge to NB 3's Newton leaf.
  **First regression in the course** (pays off ch 00's promise; by-hand parity exact only in
  regression). API verified: `loss='log_loss'` (`'deviance'` removed), **no `staged_score`** (use
  `staged_predict`), `subsample<1`→`oob_improvement_`, early stopping OFF by default. Capstone
  California housing (GBR ≈0.78 → early-stop ≈0.82 → HistGBR ≈0.84; RF ≈0.79; seed band). No `src/`

- **Chapter 08 (Gradient Boosting) opened.** Branch `chapter/08_GradientBoosting` created off `main`
  (synced @ `b256580` after PR #7). Phase `chapter-plan`: drafting the chapter plan in plan mode per
  `course_map.md` §08 and the per-method arc — boosting as **fitting the residuals** / gradient descent
  in **function space** (by hand) → the **loss** and the role of **shrinkage** (learning rate) → **trees
  as the base learner** (depth × learning_rate × n_estimators interplay) → **parameters & early
  stopping** (the bias/variance trade-off) → a **demanding case** tuning a competitive tabular model
  honestly. The **general form** of the boosting family: ch 07's AdaBoost is the exponential-loss
  special case; gradient boosting generalises to **any differentiable loss** via gradient descent in
  function space — the bridge stated at the close of ch 07. Built on ch 04's trees (the base learner)
  and ch 07's sequential error-correction; the launchpad for ch 09 XGBoost / ch 10 LightGBM. The pending
  `idle` STATE edit + `course_map.md` §07 → complete were folded into this opening commit (committed on
  the chapter branch, not on protected `main`).
- **CHAPTER 07 (AdaBoost) COMPLETE — merged to `main` via PR #7** (merge commit `b256580`,
  `gh pr merge --merge`; per-notebook history preserved; pushed to
  Ramdam17/QuickIntroToMachineLearning). Five notebooks: reweighting by hand · the additive model &
  exponential loss · learning rate / rounds & overfitting behaviour · the estimator & its parameters · a
  demanding case (spam). The course's first **boosting** method — sequential error-correction, the
  contrast with ch 06's parallel bagging; the base learner of the boosting family (ch 08–10). **No
  `src/` change** across the chapter (reused the `viz` helpers; pytest stays **20**). The two-reviewer
  gate + Rémy's visual validation held on every notebook; every number re-measured on sklearn 1.9.0;
  honest findings surfaced throughout (the SAMME-α/margin-form reconciliation; resistance ≠ immunity;
  the spam noise reversal kept **internal**, not shipped as an RF-vs-AdaBoost law; importance not causal
  / corpus artifacts). Three gate catches fixed: NB 2's reconciliation *reason*, NB 4's transposed
  CV grid (BLOCK), NB 5's breast_cancer cross-reference (MAJOR). `main` synced locally to `b256580`,

  irreducible overlap); confusion [[810,27],[43,501]] (recall 0.921 / precision 0.949, false-alarm
  asymmetry); importance **MDI vs permutation** = spam-markers (`!`,`$`,`remove`) + **HP-Labs corpus
  artifacts** (`george`,`hp`), not causal; **noise from the inside** (by-hand SAMME: ~21% flipped points
  hoard ~40% of the weight; 40%-noise test bottoms 0.142@39 → climbs 0.177@400 = resistance is not
  immunity); and the **"RF beats AdaBoost under noise" folk claim REVERSES on spam** (AdaBoost more
  robust from 20% up; 40%: 0.823 vs RF 0.704) — shown but **NOT shipped as a law** (dataset-dependent:
  the weak-stump base can't memorize noise, deep RF trees can). Reviewers: **ml-expert PASS** (by-hand
  SAMME == sklearn to 5 dp, all anchors reproduced, 8 DOIs resolved, HP-Labs/`george` provenance
  verified; 1 MINOR + 1 NIT folded); **pedagogy MAJOR → fixed → re-confirmed PASS** — cell-8 "the
  ensembles trailed on breast_cancer" was false (ch 05's spine had no ensembles; 0.965 was the *tuned*
  SVM) → re-anchored to "the tuned SVM led the four methods compared there", with the noise counter-case

  base; the `n_estimators × learning_rate` CV heatmap; CV-vs-sealed-test bars, default vs tuned). The
  **integrative** notebook, de-overloaded: parity recap (sklearn `AdaBoost(50)` test **0.9417**,
  `estimator_weights_[:3]` = [1.6796, 1.1338, 1.3854] == by-hand NB 1/2); the **base-learner-strength**

  orders results by *alphabetically-sorted* keys (`learning_rate` outer, `n_estimators` inner), so a
  naive `reshape(n, lr)` scrambled 10/12 cells and the heatmap contradicted the printed `best_params_`.
  (The bug was in the measurement script too — it slipped through.) **Fixed:** grid now built via a
  **pandas pivot** keyed on the real param values (order-independent); heatmap rows=`learning_rate`,
  cols=`n_estimators`, `origin="lower"` (bottom-left n=50/lr=0.1 = 0.911 underfit); the 0.961 best cell
  now sits at (lr=0.5, n=400) = `best_params_`. Consequential correction: **default (n50,lr1.0) CV =
  0.9536** (not 0.9429; `cross_val_score`-confirmed), tuned 0.9607, **both sealed-test 0.9417** — the
  "+0.007 CV gain didn't transfer" lesson, cleaner. Plan doc table + numbers corrected to match (+ a

  the per-method arc — boosting = **focus on the mistakes** (reweight misclassified points, by hand) →
  weak learners (decision stumps) & the **additive model** (SAMME for multiclass) → **learning rate vs
  number of rounds** and overfitting behaviour → the estimator `AdaBoostClassifier` & its parameters
  (`n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `estimator`) → a demanding case (where AdaBoost shines, and where
  **label noise** hurts it). The first **boosting** method — *sequential* error-correction, the direct
  contrast with ch 06's *parallel* bagging; built on ch 04's decision stumps as weak learners. The
  pending `idle` STATE edit was folded into this transition (committed on the chapter branch, not on

  Five notebooks: averaging cuts variance (bagging) · the "random" — decorrelating the trees · out-of-bag
  estimation · the estimator & its parameters · a demanding case (covtype). The course's **first
  ensemble** method and the base learner for the boosting family (ch 07–10). **`src/` add:**
  `viz.plot_feature_importances` + smoke test (pytest 19 → 20). The two-reviewer gate + Rémy's visual
  validation held on every notebook; every number re-measured on sklearn 1.9.0 with each RF
  `random_state`-pinned; honest findings surfaced throughout (the ρσ² floor; OOB mildly optimistic;
  `max_features` forgiving; the covtype forest wins where breast_cancer's SVM did, the reversal stated;
  the cell-18 fabricated cross-reference caught by both reviewers and corrected). `main` synced locally

  method and the direct answer to the single tree's variance (ch 04 NB 5's hand-bagged 25-tree bar was
  a first taste). The pending `idle` STATE edit was folded into this transition (committed on the

  **margin-based** method and the home of the **kernel trick**. **`src/` add:** `viz.plot_svm_decision`

  estimator & its parameters · breast_cancer (interpretability vs accuracy). The first **non-linear**,
  rule-based method and the **base learner** for the ensemble half of the course. **No `src/` change**
  (pytest stays 17; `load_breast_cancer` reused from ch 03). The two-reviewer gate + Rémy's visual
  validation held on every notebook; sklearn-1.9 anchors re-measured throughout; Rémy's spot-checks
  caught real issues that were fixed (NB 3 thin-band rendering → verified real tree regions; NB 4
  leaf-count read; NB 5 threshold conflation). `main` synced locally to `5f61e56`, green (pytest 17).
  STATE set to `idle` (pending edit, folds into the chapter-05 opening). Next: chapter `05_SVM`.

  **capstone**, visualization-first: 26 cells, 6 figures (class balance; depth-3 tree rules via
  `plot_tree`; cross-method accuracy bar KNN 0.942 / LogReg 0.953 / single tree 0.906 / bagged-25
  0.930; root-feature flips; Gini-vs-permutation importance; confusion matrix). Full honest workflow on
  breast_cancer (malignant=1): tree CV-on-train 0.940 < LogReg 0.985; tuned tree test 0.906 < 0.953;
  depth-3 readable rules (test 0.918); single-tree variance (root feature flips: concave points 15× …,
  std 0.021); **Gini (concave points 0.74) vs permutation (worst area 0.27) disagree** (NB 4's caveat
  made real); confusion `[[95,12],[4,60]]` (4/64 cancers missed); **hand-bagged 25 trees → 0.930**
  (the ensemble bridge to ch 06). **Both reviewers folded:** pedagogy PASS (2 MINORs); ml-expert
  REVISE → 1 MAJOR fixed (cell-22 "LogReg caught more" conflated the default vs lowered threshold — at
  0.5 both miss the same 4 cancers, LogReg's edge is fewer false alarms; reframed) + MINORs ("recovers

  OPENED.** Branch `notebook/04_DecisionTree__05_breast_cancer_interpretability` off
  `chapter/04_DecisionTree` (@ `e9447f4`). Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting the cell-by-cell plan in
  plan mode — the chapter **capstone**, **visualization-first**. Full honest workflow on breast_cancer
  (569×30, malignant=1): the readable depth-3 rule set vs the tree's accuracy cost (tree < LogReg), the
  single tree's high variance (root-feature flips), Gini + permutation importance, the cross-method
  test spine, and the bridge to ensembles (ch 06). Anchors in the chapter plan §NB 5; re-measured at
  plan time. **This is the last notebook of chapter 04** — after it ships, the chapter closes via PR

  bootstrap trees' leaf counts differ, but both grow 17 → reframed to "same 17 leaves, different
  boundary, test 0.900 vs 0.833 = variance"; MINOR — added a leakage note (whole-set standardization

  `notebook/04_DecisionTree__04_estimator_and_parameters` off `chapter/04_DecisionTree` (@ `fb607f8`).
  Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting the cell-by-cell plan in plan mode — the **integrative** notebook
  (~24-cell ceiling, dé-surcharged at chapter-plan): parity vs NB 2; 4 shown dials (`max_depth`,
  `min_samples_leaf`, `ccp_alpha`, `criterion`) + 2 named (`max_features`, `class_weight`); the
  **variance/instability headline** (the ensemble bridge); trees' native strengths (scale-invariance,
  multiclass + NaN on `penguins_full`); Gini importance + bias caveat; `GridSearchCV`. Anchors from
  the chapter plan; specifics re-measured at plan time. Next: Rémy validates the NB-4 plan → build.
- **NB 3 (overfitting & pruning) BUILT & MERGED to `chapter/04_DecisionTree` — Rémy validated
  visually.** Rémy flagged the thin horizontal/vertical bands in the deep-tree boundaries as
  surprising; **re-verified they are real tree regions** (unpruned tree: 13 x1-cuts min gap 0.0044, 9
  x2-cuts min gap 0.0124 — fences around individual noise points; identical at render res 300 vs 800,
  so not an aliasing artefact) and **tightened both "Read the figure" cells** to name them as real
  overfitting, not a glitch (`common_errors` gained a matching row). 21 cells, 4 figures on
  `make_moons(300, 0.30, 0)`: 3 boundaries (depth 1 underfit / 6 good / unlimited jagged); train/test
  **error U-curve** vs depth (train→0 by depth 8, test U min ~depth 6–7) with the CV-best-depth line;
  **cost-complexity pruning path** (test acc + #leaves vs `ccp_alpha`); **unpruned (23-leaf, jagged,
  test 0.878) vs CV-pruned (8-leaf, smooth, test 0.900)** boundary. Honest selection: CV picks depth 6
  (0.919) on train → sealed test 0.889 (deliberately *not* the test max 0.900 at depth 7); CV-best
  `ccp_alpha` ≈ 0.0087 → 8 leaves / test 0.900. **Both reviewers PASS (no BLOCK).** ml-expert
  reproduced every number, confirmed no leakage, `ccp_alphas[:-1]` root-drop correct; pedagogy
  confirmed one-concept + charter + figure-read accuracy. MINORs folded (dangling "Figure A/C" →
  content refs; "training error"→"training impurity"; a guard that CV-best=test-max here is the seed
  being kind, not the rule; plateau "8–13 leaves"). Guards: 0 banned, ruff clean, hex clean, pytest 17,

  Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting the cell-by-cell plan in plan mode — one concept, **overfitting &
  pruning**, on `make_moons(300, 0.30, 0)` (the chapter's first move to the non-linear set; depth
  boundaries 1/6/unlimited; train/test U-curve; cost-complexity `ccp_alpha`; CV choice). Anchors

  validated visually.** 20 cells, 2
  figures (a **custom charter-coloured flowchart** of the depth-2 tree — drawn by hand so Adélie/Gentoo
  colours stay consistent, not sklearn's clashing blue/orange; decision regions depth-1 (2 boxes) vs
  depth-2 (4 boxes)). By hand: recurse NB 1's `flipper ≤ 206` → left `bill ≤ 47.20`, right `bill ≤
  40.85` → 4 leaves (149/0, 0/1, 1/0, 1/122); **by-hand == `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)`**
  (train 0.9964); CV depth-2 0.9855 > full 0.9818 (overfitting hook → NB 3); the one error = row 128 (a
  long-flippered Adélie in the Gentoo box); greedy ≠ optimal (NP-hard); depth-3 adds a leaf but no
  accuracy. **Both reviewers PASS (no BLOCK).** ml-expert verified parity, the depth-3 reason, the CV
  reproduction, all DOIs; pedagogy verified one-concept + charter + figure-read accuracy. MINORs folded
  (both flagged the "box-counting in NB 1" back-ref → reworded self-contained; CV got a "here"
  single-seed qualifier + a one-line gloss + added to header prereqs; flowchart 47.2→47.20 for

  Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting the cell-by-cell plan in plan mode — one concept, **recursive greedy
  growth + reading the tree**, by hand on penguins (recurse NB 1's `flipper ≤ 206` to depth 2 → 4
  leaves; read it as a flowchart; trace a penguin; parity vs `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)`).
  Anchors (sklearn 1.9): depth-2 train 0.9964 / 4 leaves / CV 0.9855 > full 0.9818; rules root

  for the ragged bill curve; kept the "Read the result" twin convention); **ml-expert REVISE → 1 MAJOR
  fixed** (the ch-03 `bill`-vs-`flipper` callback fabricated a false contrast — ch 03 introduced the
  sigmoid on `bill` by *narrative* choice and a linear fit also favours `flipper` here → reframed to "we

- **NB 1 (a question that splits the data: impurity) OPENED.** Branch
  `notebook/04_DecisionTree__01_impurity_and_splits` off `chapter/04_DecisionTree` (@ `ee99b25`).
  Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting the cell-by-cell plan in plan mode — one concept, **impurity & the
  best split**, by hand on the binary penguins subset (raw units). Anchors (sklearn 1.9.0): root
  Gini 0.4948 / entropy 0.9925 bits; best split `flipper ≤ 206` (Gini decrease 0.4732) beats
  `bill ≤ 43.25` (0.4044) — *the "best feature" depends on the criterion*; depth-1 stump 0.9891; the

- **Chapter 04 (Decision Trees) plan APPROVED & persisted** (`docs/plans/chapter_04_DecisionTree.md`,
  commit `b2c9308`). **FIVE notebooks** (standard arc): NB 1 impurity & the best split (Gini/entropy,
  by hand on penguins) → NB 2 greedy growth + reading the tree → NB 3 overfitting & pruning (the depth
  dial, on `make_moons`) → NB 4 the estimator `DecisionTreeClassifier` & its parameters
  (**variance/instability the headline**) → NB 5 demanding case **breast_cancer** (interpretability vs
  accuracy; where a single tree fails → the bridge to ensembles). First **non-linear** method; the
  **base learner** of ch 06–10. Reviewer-gated, both **REVISE → all folded** (every number re-measured
  by Claude on sklearn 1.9.0): **ml-expert** (MAJOR — NB 5 CV → **CV-on-train** tree 0.940 / LogReg
  0.985 matching shipped ch 03 NB 6; MAJOR — `criterion` re-measured at **default depth** 0.910 / 0.914
  + the no-logarithm-cost argument; MINORs — depth 6 = CV-best not test-peak (peak is depth 7 / 0.900),
  NaN = 2 numeric rows, variance recipe **pinned** `default_rng(0)`/20/`rs=0`/150² grid). **pedagogy**

  close named). Rémy chose **breast_cancer** for NB 5 (over `penguins_full` / a Titanic loader).
  `course_map.md` §04 already aligned. Next: open NB 1.
- **Chapter 04 (Decision Trees) opened.** Branch `chapter/04_DecisionTree` created off `main` (synced
  @ `8cdcc73` after PR #3). Phase `chapter-plan`: drafting the chapter plan in plan mode per
  `course_map.md` §04 and the per-method arc (a split & impurity by hand → grow & read a tree →
  overfitting/pruning & the depth dial; NB 4 `DecisionTreeClassifier` & its parameters; NB 5 a
  demanding case — interpretability vs accuracy, where a single tree fails). The first **non-linear,
  axis-aligned partition** method, and the **base learner** the ensemble half of the course
  (06 Random Forest → the boosting family) is built on. The pending `idle` STATE edit was folded
  into this transition (committed on the chapter branch, not on protected `main`).
- **CHAPTER 03 (Logistic Regression) COMPLETE — merged to `main` via PR #3** (merge commit `8cdcc73`,
  `gh pr merge --merge`; per-notebook history preserved; pushed to Ramdam17/QuickIntroToMachineLearning).
  Six notebooks: score→probability · boundary & weights · log-loss · gradient descent · estimator &
  parameters · breast_cancer (calibration/threshold). Added `datasets.load_breast_cancer()` + schema test
  (`pytest` 17). The two-reviewer gate + Rémy's visual validation held on every notebook; the sklearn-1.9
  API was pinned throughout; every number re-measured. `main` synced locally to `8cdcc73`, green. STATE
  set to `idle` (pending edit, folds into the chapter-04 opening). Next: chapter `04_DecisionTree`.
- **NB 6 (demanding case: breast cancer) built & merged — CHAPTER 03 COMPLETE (6/6).** The capstone,
  visualization-first (5 figures), on breast_cancer (569×30, malignant = positive). Honest workflow, no
  leakage: split → CV **on train** (LogReg **0.985** > GaussianNB **0.932**) → one sealed test (acc 0.953).
  **Calibration** closes ch 02's loop: LogReg Brier **0.033** vs GaussianNB **0.098** (~3×); a pile-up
  histogram makes GaussianNB's over-confidence visible (166 vs 119/171 at the extremes); reliability diagram
  with the y=x reference. **Threshold = clinical policy** (malignant the costly miss): 0.5 → recall 0.938
  (4/64 missed) vs 0.1 → 0.984 (1 missed, 14 false alarms). **L1** keeps 3/10/14 of 30; **coefficient story**
  (radius/concavity → malignant, clinically sensible). Bridge to trees (ch 04). **src/ add:**
  `datasets.load_breast_cancer()` pandas wrapper + schema test → **pytest 17**. Both reviewers folded
  (ml-expert REVISE→cell-8 truncated sentence + coef-read MINORs; pedagogy PASS→added the reliability
  diagonal, reworded ex-3 for the 1.9 `CalibratedClassifierCV`/`FrozenEstimator` API; several anchors

  Role-4: the real `sklearn LogisticRegression` on the **1.9 API** (verified: `l1_ratio` not the deprecated
  `penalty`; no `multi_class`; `saga` for L1; `C=np.inf`=none). Parity vs by-hand (NB 4). Knobs *shown*:

  One concept: **the optimizer** (the course's first), by hand on standardized 1-D `bill_length` (w & b).
  Gradient **(P−y)·x** stated & **verified** (finite-diff err 2e-11; σ′ cancels); update w←w−η∇L; descent
  on NB 3's convex bowl (figB surface+path → bottom; figC loss → floor 0.140). **Parity exact**: by-hand
  GD = `LogisticRegression(C=∞)` (6.29704 / −0.56139) — "the library is not magic". Learning-rate panel
  (figD): 0.1 crawls / 2 glides / 400 overshoots; raw-feature knife-edge (0.003 vs 0.005) = the
  "why standardize" tie-in. Convergence **shown, not proved** (leans on NB 3 convexity); SGD/backprop only
  named (→ ch 11–12). 22 cells, 4 figures. Both reviewers **PASS** (0 BLOCK/MAJOR): every number
  re-derived to machine precision; parity against C=∞ verified (default C=1 → w=4.25, different, so the
  choice is load-bearing). **MINORs folded:** softened "diverges/explodes/leaps past" → "overshoots /
  climbs the wrong way" (on this flat loss η=400 stays bounded, not →∞ — honest); **lr-panel η 90→400
  deviation from the approved plan** (90 did not visibly diverge on the well-conditioned loss — a
  correctness fix; title/legend/read all updated). `common_errors` gained a learning-rate row; `llms.txt`

  Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting cell-by-cell in plan mode — one concept, **the course's first
  optimizer**: gradient = steepest-ascent direction; step opposite by a learning rate; the weights roll to
  the bottom of NB 3's convex bowl. Gradient **(P−y)·x** (verified vs finite-diff to 2e-11). Anchors
  measured: by-hand full-batch GD on standardized 1-D `bill_length` (w,b) → `LogisticRegression(C=∞)`
  w*=6.297 / b*=−0.561 (gap 4e-4 at lr=1, 1e-7 at lr=2; ~1000 it at lr=0.5); learning-rate panel
  **standardized** (lr 0.1 crawls / 2 glides / 90 oscillates; surface flat, λ_max=0.041, stable to ~48) —
  divergence shown on **raw** bill as the knife-edge (0.003 crawls, 0.005 explodes → the "why standardize"

  One concept: **the training objective**, by hand, pre-fitting. **log-loss = cross-entropy = −log-
  likelihood** of the Bernoulli model (the bridge from ch 02's likelihood); punishes confident-and-wrong
  without bound (−log P; P=0.01→4.6) where squared error caps at 1 (Figure A); **convex** (one bottom,

  (P−y)·x and analytic convexity L''≥0; **1 BLOCK = banned word "simply" cell 18 → "exactly"**; MINOR
  bowl-ylim wording), **pedagogy PASS** (added a Bernoulli coin-flip gloss; the honest "single min, not
  bumps" framing praised). **Process fix:** the banned-word guard now parses the JSON real text — the old
  raw-`.ipynb` grep missed words glued after a literal `\n` (that is how "simply" slipped past); NB 1–2
  re-scanned **clean**. `common_errors` gained a "train with squared error" row; `llms.txt` regenerated;
  ruff/hex/banned clean; pytest 16. Rémy validated visually. Next: open NB 4 (gradient descent).
- **NB 3 (Fitting I — what we optimize: log-loss) OPENED.** Branch
  `notebook/03_LogisticRegression__03_logloss_objective` off `chapter/03_LogisticRegression` (@ `d15035d`).
  Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting cell-by-cell in plan mode — one concept, **the objective**: log-loss =
  cross-entropy = −log-likelihood of the Bernoulli model (bridge from ch 02's likelihood), punishes
  confident-and-wrong (−log P unbounded); **log-loss convex** (one bottom) vs **squared-error-on-sigmoid
  non-convex with stalling plateaus**. Anchors measured (1-D std bill: w*≈6.29 / b*≈−0.56, log-loss convex
  min 0.140; MSE 2nd-diff < 0, plateau slope ~3e-4 at w=20; per-example y=1/P=0.01 → log-loss 4.6 vs MSE
  0.98; hand weights w=1/3/6.3 → 0.398/0.188/0.140). **Note:** real 1-D data shows non-convex + plateaus
  (single min), not multiple "bumps" — framing adjusted from the chapter plan's "bumpy", flagged to Rémy.
  Next: Rémy validates the NB-3 plan → build.
- **NB 2 (decision boundary & reading the weights) built & merged to `chapter/03_LogisticRegression`.**
  One concept: **the weighted line & what its weights mean**, by hand, pre-fitting. On **standardized**
  bill+flipper: z=w₁x₁+w₂x₂+b, the **decision boundary** (z=0, P=½), **w ⟂ boundary** & ‖w‖=steepness,
  each **wⱼ = Δ log-odds per std unit** (×e^wⱼ to the odds: bill ×2.7, flipper ×7.4). Hand weights
  w=(1,2), b=0 (nothing fitted — "NB 3–4 find them"): acc **0.9891**, ‖w‖ 2.24, band ~37 % (the 3 errors
  all in-band). Contrast **nearest-centroid** unweighted bisector → **tilt 16.3°** = the weighting (NC acc
  0.9927). Figure C: weights rotate the line, b shifts it. 21 cells, 3 figures. Both reviewers folded:
  **ml-expert PASS** (every number re-measured exact; ‖w‖=steepness verified = ‖w‖/4 slope at z=0; no
  hidden `.fit`; 3 DOIs resolve), **pedagogy REVISE→all folded** (MAJOR: the w arrow didn't render
  perpendicular under unequal axes → `set_aspect("equal")` on figs A/B/C; MINORs: white→blue wording, and
  named that the borderline example is a real in-band error). Dropped the optional ~64° fit teaser (both
  reviewers preferred the clean no-fitting wall). `common_errors` gained a weight-magnitude/standardize
  row; `llms.txt` regenerated; ruff/hex/banned-word clean; pytest 16. Rémy validated visually. Next: open
  NB 3 (log-loss).
- **NB 2 (decision boundary & reading the weights) OPENED.** Branch
  `notebook/03_LogisticRegression__02_boundary_and_weights` created off `chapter/03_LogisticRegression`
  (@ `cbf90d0`). Phase `notebook-plan`: drafting the cell-by-cell plan in plan mode — one concept, on
  **standardized** bill+flipper: the weighted line z=w₁x₁+w₂x₂+b, the **decision boundary** (z=0, P=½),
  **w ⟂ the boundary** & sets steepness, each **wⱼ = Δ log-odds per standardized unit**; weights **set by
  hand** (rotate with w, shift with b), contrasted with module-00 nearest-centroid's *unweighted* bisector;
  **nothing fitted** (NB 3–4 find the weights). Anchors measured at plan time (scaler stats, fitted std
  coefs as the ballpark, NC-normal vs logistic-w angle). Next: Rémy validates the NB-2 plan → build.
- **NB 1 (From a linear score to a probability) built & merged to `chapter/03_LogisticRegression`.**
  One concept: **the sigmoid & log-odds**, fully by hand, pre-fitting. σ(z)=1/(1+e⁻ᶻ) coded from
  scratch & plotted → **p→odds→log-odds** table (the score *is* the log-odds; σ and logit are
  inverses) → σ applied to `bill_length` (**raw mm**) with **hand-chosen** weights (w=1.0, b=−43,
  ½-crossing **43 mm**; nothing fitted — "NB 3–4 find these") → ½-threshold prediction → borderline
  42.9 mm example (P=0.475). Build-measured: hand-rule acc **0.945** (≈ fitted 0.947, never called the
  optimum), transition band ~**21.5 %**. 19 cells, 2 figures. Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK):
  ml-expert verified σ↔logit to 1e-14, the no-fitting promise airtight (no hidden `.fit`), all 3 DOIs
  resolve, calibration correctly **not** claimed; pedagogy confirmed one-concept + e/σ/odds-log-odds
  built from scratch. **2 MINORs folded** (log=natural-log base e; "a fifth" tied to the P∈[0.1,0.9]
  band); **skipped a 3rd** ("all 15 errors in the band") — measured 12/15 in band, 3 confidently-wrong
  → false, and that nuance belongs to NB 6. `common_errors` gained a score-vs-probability/log-odds row;
  `llms.txt` regenerated; ruff fixed (notebook import order I001); pytest 16. Rémy validated visually.
  Next: open NB 2.
- **Chapter 03 (Logistic Regression) plan APPROVED & persisted** (`docs/plans/chapter_03_LogisticRegression.md`).
  **SIX notebooks** (Rémy-approved exception to the 5-ceiling, like KNN's 6th): NB 1 sigmoid & log-odds
  → NB 2 decision boundary & reading weights → NB 3 **log-loss** (the objective) → NB 4 **gradient
  descent** (the optimizer — split from NB 3 on Rémy's go) → NB 5 estimator & parameters
  (`LogisticRegression`: C, `l1_ratio` L1/L2, softmax) → NB 6 demanding case **breast_cancer**
  (calibration/threshold/error analysis). First **discriminative** method; first trained by **iterative
  optimization**; closes ch 02's generative-vs-discriminative loop. Reviewer-gated, both **REVISE→all
  folded**: **ml-expert** (2 BLOCK — NB 1 sigmoid 30%/46mm self-contradiction → raw-mm acc 0.947 /
  crossing ≈43 mm / ~16 %; breast_cancer CV unreproducible → pinned StratifiedKFold5-shuffle LogReg
  **0.979** vs GaussianNB **0.930**; + GaussianNB calibration re-measured under one std pipeline Brier
  **0.088**/pile 167, GD parity vs `C=np.inf`, ‖w‖₂ over 4 std feats, OvR 0.952) — verified the
  **sklearn-1.9 API pivot** (`penalty` deprecated→`l1_ratio`; no `multi_class`→`OneVsRestClassifier`;
  `saga` for L1) and gradient ∝(P−y)·x to machine precision; **pedagogy** (1 BLOCK 2 banned words; 3
  MAJOR — split GD to its own NB, add odds/log-odds + gradient-as-slope first-contacts, give softmax its
  own section). Measured at plan time on sklearn **1.9.0**. `course_map.md` §03 aligned to six titles.
  Next: open NB 1.
- **Chapter 03 (Logistic Regression) opened.** Branch `chapter/03_LogisticRegression` created off
  `main` (synced @ `726d13e` after PR #2). Phase `chapter-plan`: drafting the chapter plan in plan
  mode per `course_map.md` §03 and the per-method arc (sigmoid → boundary/weights → log-loss fitting;
  NB 4 `LogisticRegression` C/L1-L2/multi-class; NB 5 calibration + threshold + error analysis —
  LogReg as the calibrated discriminative foil to NB's over-confidence). The pending `idle` STATE
  edit was folded into this transition (committed on the chapter branch, not on protected `main`).
- **NB 5 (Text classification — the demanding case) built & merged; CHAPTER 02 COMPLETE (5/5).** The
  capstone, on 20-newsgroups: **by-hand bag-of-words on-ramp** (toy sentences → vocab → dense count
  matrix) → `CountVectorizer` (12 384 words, density 0.0043, fit-on-train-only) → `MultinomialNB`
  (fit ≈ms, acc **0.887**, confusion → religion hardest) → **honest eval under imbalance** (one-vs-rest
  sci.med: acc **0.930** vs **baseline 0.724**, P/R/F1 0.887/0.854/0.870, PR AP 0.935) → **calibration**
  (MNB piles 1205/1433 at 0/1 = over-confident *in shape*; Brier 0.056 < LogReg 0.080 here because the
  task is easy → "trust the ranking, not the number"; cost shown on the confusable pair in Your turn) →
  Domingos-Pazzani at scale + **generative-vs-discriminative bridge to ch 03**. 27 cells, 5 figures.
  **2 `src/` additions with tests** (`datasets.load_newsgroups` fetch-and-cache + visible logging;
  `viz.plot_calibration_curve` reliability diagram) → **pytest 16**. Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK):
  ml-expert verified every number + measured that keeping metadata leaks the label (0.887→0.955, so
  `remove=` is right); pedagogy confirmed the by-hand on-ramp + honest calibration framing. 5 MINORs
  folded (calibration wording, "crushes most", no-skill label value, multinomial pointer). `common_errors`
  + `course_map` §02 + `llms.txt` updated. Rémy validated visually. Next: PR `chapter/02_NaiveBayes` →
  `main`, then open chapter 03 (Logistic Regression).
- **NB 4 (The estimators & their parameters) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** The
  integration notebook: the NB family (Gaussian/Multinomial/Bernoulli) + each dial *measured* —
  **`var_smoothing`** (flat 0.9927 → 1.0:0.989 → 10:0.711, the flood), **`alpha`/Laplace** healing NB 1's
  penguins zero by hand (α=0→0; α=1→0.0065/post 0.018; verified by-hand == `MultinomialNB.feature_log_prob_`),
  **`priors`/`fit_prior`** tilting the boundary (124↔127 predicted Gentoo; borderline x=[40.8,208] flips
  Adélie→Gentoo at P(Gentoo) 0.15/0.5/0.85), and **honest tuning** (GridSearchCV on train, one sealed
  test). **Calibration named & deferred to NB 5** (penguins too separable, well-calibrated). 20 cells,
  3 figures. Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK): ml-expert REVISE → the asserted Brier 0.0006 reframed as
  a NB-5 forward reference (split-dependent, unshown) + 2 MINORs; pedagogy PASS + 2 MINORs (flip sweep
  aligned to the panels). Rémy questioned whether NB 4 was a 4th concept notebook → confirmed it is the
  role-4 "method & parameters" notebook; chapter stays **5**. `common_errors.md` gained a
  "don't max out smoothing" row; `llms.txt` regenerated; pytest 14. Rémy validated visually.
- **NB 3 (The Gaussian likelihood, computed safely) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** One
  concept (chapter stays 5 — split not pulled): model P(feature∣class) with a continuous **density**,
  computed in **log-space**. Bins (NB 1) were crude → **density first-contact** taught from scratch
  (area not height; integrates to 1; can exceed 1) → per-class **Gaussian** fit (Adélie μ38.79/σ2.65,
  Gentoo μ47.50/σ3.07) overlaid on the density histogram (mass→density; the zero-frequency trap
  dissolves) → **by-hand Gaussian NB = sklearn `GaussianNB` 100 %** (acc 0.9927; curved boundary) →
  likelihood is a choice (multinomial/Bernoulli named → NB 5) → **underflow** (product → 0.0 at N=324)
  → **log-space** (sum of log-likelihoods, argmax unchanged). 20 cells, 4 figures, "Your turn" ×3. Both
  reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK); folded: **3 banned words** ("simply" ×2, "just"), `var_smoothing`
  honesty (by-hand = GaussianNB with smoothing off; scores differ <1e-6 → NB 4 dial), the log-tie
  clause, σ gloss, and a NaN/3rd-species hint on exercise (a). `common_errors.md` gained underflow +
  density-height rows; `llms.txt` regenerated; pytest 14 (no `src/`). Rémy validated visually.
- **NB 2 (The "naive" assumption) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** One concept:
  **conditional independence**. Two features need the joint P(bill,flipper∣species); estimating it
  directly is expensive (5×5 grid, **18/25 cells empty** — curse echo). The naive shortcut: assume
  independence given the class → joint = product of 1-D marginals. **Where it breaks**, measured: real
  vs naive joint heatmaps + a **difference panel** (the discarded correlation), within-class corr
  **0.326/0.661** (vs overall 0.869 = mostly between-class). **Does the decision survive?** CV
  GaussianNB **0.9927** ties LDA, beats QDA **0.9890** (Domingos & Pazzani 1997). Honest: GaussianNB =
  QDA with diagonal covariance; the tie is an accuracy coincidence on near-separable data (NB/LDA
  boundaries differ on 11.5 %, NB/QDA on 18.2 % — verified by ml-expert), *not* a model identity; the
  probabilities suffer even when the decision holds (→ NB 5 calibration). 21 cells, 3 figures, "Your
  turn" ×3. Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK); shared MINOR folded ("Read the table" for the count
  grid). `common_errors.md` gained an overall-vs-within-class-correlation row; `llms.txt` regenerated;
  pytest 14 (no `src/` change). Rémy validated visually.
- **NB 1 (Bayes' rule, from counts) built & merged to `chapter/02_NaiveBayes`.** By hand on the binary
  penguins subset: the **prior** P(species) 0.551/0.449 by counting → `bill_length` 3-bin contingency
  (Adélie [135,16,0] / Gentoo [3,67,53]) → **likelihood** P(bin∣species) by row-normalizing → **Bayes'
  rule** (4 terms named) → **posterior** P(species∣bin) (short→Adélie 0.978, medium→Gentoo 0.807,
  long→Gentoo 1.000) → predict by **argmax**, with "evidence cancels under argmax" *demonstrated*
  (`joint.idxmax == posterior.idxmax` True). The bin `long` surfaces the **live zero-frequency case**
  (no Adélie → P=0 → posterior exactly 0/1, overconfident) → foreshadows NB 4 smoothing. 21 cells, 3
  figures (prior bar / likelihood grouped bar / posterior stacked bar), "Your turn" ×3, vocabulary box.
  Both reviewers **PASS** (no BLOCK): ml-expert re-derived every number by exact fractions (45/46, 67/83);
  pedagogy confirmed one-concept + voice. 4 MINORs folded (conditional-probability gloss + drop "joint"
  cell 10; discrete-likelihood-normalization hedge cell 12; exhaustivity already in cell 6). Rémy
  validated visually. `common_errors.md` gained a zero-frequency row; `llms.txt` regenerated; pytest 14
  green (no `src/` change).
- **Chapter 02 (Naive Bayes) plan APPROVED & persisted** (`docs/plans/chapter_02_NaiveBayes.md`).
  5 notebooks, standard arc: NB 1 Bayes from counts (one feature, by hand) → NB 2 the naive
  (conditional-independence) assumption → NB 3 the Gaussian likelihood + log-space → NB 4 the
  estimators & parameters (var_smoothing, alpha/zero-frequency, priors, calibration-bridge) → NB 5
  demanding case = **text classification** (20newsgroups, MultinomialNB, honest eval under imbalance,
  the over-confidence limit, generative-vs-discriminative bridge to ch 03). Datasets: penguins (NB 1–4,
  Gaussian) + a 20newsgroups subset (NB 5, fetch-and-cache). Reviewer-gated: **ml-expert REVISE→1 BLOCK
  fixed** (the headline error: GaussianNB is **QDA with diagonal per-class covariance**, *not* LDA — the
  0.9927 NB/LDA/QDA tie is an accuracy coincidence on near-separable 2-D data; re-checked PASS at the
  parameter level), unfair NB(raw)-vs-LogReg(scaled) → both raw, α-curve marked version-indicative.
  **pedagogy REVISE→no BLOCK** (4 MAJORs folded: NB 3 re-scoped to one concept with mass→density as a
  taught first-contact; bag-of-words built by hand in NB 5; NB 4 calibration as a tight bridge; "Your
  turn" per NB). Measured at plan time: within-class corr 0.326/0.661/0.486; NB/QDA/LDA 0.9927/0.9890/
  0.9927; text acc ≈0.89 (4-cat) / ≈0.70 (hard binary); α→0 = log(0) collapse. Next: open NB 1.
- **Chapter 02 (Naive Bayes) opened.** Branch `chapter/02_NaiveBayes` created off `main` (synced to
  `110c081` after PR #1). Phase `chapter-plan`: drafting the chapter plan in plan mode per
  `course_map.md` §02 and the per-method arc. The pending `idle` STATE edit was folded into this
  transition (committed on the chapter branch, not on protected `main`).
- **Chapter 01 (k-Nearest Neighbours) COMPLETE — 6 notebooks merged to `main` via PR #1** (merge commit
  `110c081`, `gh pr merge --merge` — per-notebook history preserved; pushed to
  `Ramdam17/QuickIntroToMachineLearning`). The arc: the vote → distance & the scale trap → the k dial →
  the estimator & its parameters → demanding case + the curse → advanced distances & nested CV. The
  two-reviewer gate (`@ml-expert-reviewer` + `@pedagogy-reviewer`) + Rémy's visual validation held on
  every notebook; NB 6 was rebuilt from scratch (v1 was visually thin). Next: chapter `02_NaiveBayes`.
- **NB 6 (advanced: distances & choosing k) built & merged — chapter complete (6/6).** Optional Advanced
  capstone, **rebuilt from scratch (v1 scrapped by Rémy as too table-heavy)** → visualization-first, 28
  cells, **9 figures**: unit balls L1/L2/L∞; metric decision boundaries on moons; Mahalanobis ellipse +
  Euclidean-vs-Mahalanobis boundary on penguins; distance-concentration histogram (d=2/50/1000);
  near/far ratio by p; accuracy-vs-noise curve (penguins wash vs breast_cancer p=1>p=2, averaged over 8
  draws); nested-CV schematic + fold-score strip (naive 0.967 vs nested 0.960). Both datasets featured;
  silhouette dropped (it concerns k-means cluster count, not k-NN's k). Pedagogy PASS; ml-expert
  REVISE→fixed (L1 unit-ball geometry — vertices on axes, not sides; "staircase"→tendency; LDA→incise).
  Rémy validated. `feat(01_knn): notebook 06 — advanced: distances & choosing k`. **Note:** a stray
  `/tmp/struct.py` shadows stdlib `struct` for `python /tmp/*.py` → build via `uv run python - < file`.
- **NB 5 (demanding case: breast cancer & the curse) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** Full honest
  workflow on `load_breast_cancer` (569×30): pandas look → `Pipeline(StandardScaler, KNN)` (raw CV
  0.935 vs scaled **0.970**, NB 2 scale trap on real data) → CV picks **k=7** → one held-out eval (test
  **0.947**) → error analysis: confusion `[[57,7],[2,105]]`, **malignant recall 0.891 = 7 of 64 cancers
  missed** (accuracy hid it; threshold → NB 8) → when to/not use k-NN → **the curse, felt**: CV acc
  **0.970→0.771** as noise dims grow, near/far ratio **0.121→0.909** (→1, the *why*, Beyer 1999). Curse
  via `cross_val_score` on TRAIN (test stays used-once); near/far = pure geometry. Both reviewers PASS
  (re-derived leak-free, near/far = Beyer's inverse relevant-contrast confirmed; applied MINORs:
  plan-table→CV numbers, curse-is-CV framing + Pipeline-rescales note, asymptotic wording, prereqs
  +06/+08). Rémy validated. `feat(01_knn): notebook 05 — demanding case: breast cancer & the curse`.
  **Build note:** a stray `/tmp/struct.py` (a notebook cell-lister) shadows stdlib `struct` for `python
  /tmp/*.py` (sys.path[0]=/tmp) → run builders via `uv run python - < /tmp/x.py` (stdin) instead.
- **NB 4 (the estimator & its parameters) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** Introduced
  `KNeighborsClassifier`: parity with by-hand (0 diff, 0.956) and `cross_val_score` == NB 3's **0.919**;
  walked `n_neighbors` / `weights` / `metric`. weights uniform vs distance (k=151: 0.678 vs 0.833,
  boundary panels) — **mechanism corrected** after ml review: it is a graded 1/d *tilt* (effective
  ~73/151, nearest-15 hold ~34 %), NOT "near dominates", and 0.833 stays well below uniform@15's 0.956
  (degrades gracefully, doesn't recover). metric small effect (Manhattan p=1 0.967); chose weights by
  `cross_val_score` (distance 0.924 → test 0.967); even-k tie → lowest-label argmax (== by-hand
  `bincount().argmax()` convention) → odd k for binary (binary-only; 3-class can still tie). Pedagogy
  PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed (1 MAJOR: false distance-weight mechanism, re-measured & corrected; +
  MINORs: parity edge-case, argmax convention, figure wording). Rémy validated visually. `feat(01_knn):
  notebook 04 — the estimator & its parameters`.
- **NB 3 (the k dial) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** By-hand k-NN on `make_moons`: k as the
  bias–variance dial — boundaries k=1 (jagged/memorize) / 15 / 151 (over-smooth), contrasted with NB
  05's single bisector; train/test error vs k (log axis, the U; k=1 train err **0.000**); then the
  honest selection — show the test curve, **refuse to use it**, **5-fold CV on TRAIN picks k=15** (cv
  0.919), one sealed test eval → **0.956** (vs k=1 0.933, k=151 0.678). Surfaces (not hides) the
  test-min=k3 vs CV=k15 disagreement. CV by hand (`StratifiedKFold`+loop); `KNeighborsClassifier` /
  `cross_val_score` deferred to NB 4. Both reviewers **PASS** (re-derived CV leak-free; applied 6 fixes:
  variance-inferred-not-measured nod to NB 09, gap *indicates* overfit, CV-fold-seed wobble, odd-k
  explained, boundaries-on-train named, k15/0.956 seed-caveat). Rémy validated visually. `feat(01_knn):
  notebook 03 — the k dial`.
- **NB 2 (distance & the scale trap) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** By-hand k-NN on
  `make_moons`: Euclidean vs Manhattan (a genuine L1/L2 ranking flip — q=(0,0): L2 picks B=(0.7,0.7),
  L1 picks A=(1,0)), then the scale trap — feature 2 ×50 collapses test acc **0.956 → 0.733**,
  standardizing on **train stats** recovers it **exactly** (caveat stated: exact recovery is special to
  a pure rescale); raw-vs-standardized **decision boundary** (horizontal bands slicing the crescents →
  the two-moon S recovered, both PNGs eyeballed). Honest scoping: metric (0.956 vs 0.944 = **one** test
  point of 90) ≪ scale (~20 pts). Tiny in-notebook `ByHandKNN` wrapper reuses
  `viz.plot_decision_boundary` (single split; CV deferred to NB 3). Both reviewers **PASS**
  (re-measured; applied 5 fixes: "34× linear → ~34²≈1000× in the squared sum", metric-gap-is-one-point,
  ISLR §2.2.3 **& ch. 4**, a `ByHandKNN` framing cell naming the fit/predict interface, forced axis
  labels). Rémy validated visually. `feat(01_knn): notebook 02 — distance & the scale trap`.
- **NB 1 (predict by the neighbourhood vote) built & merged to `chapter/01_KNN`.** k-NN by hand on
  `make_moons(300, 0.30, 0)` (210/90): the majority vote, *k* = neighbourhood size, and the lazy cost
  **felt live** (fit flat ~µs vs predict super-linear at n=300/3000/30000). At build, the running query
  was **re-measured and corrected**: the planned q=(0.60,0.14) sat on the Bayes boundary (~50/50, so
  "true class 0" was dishonest); replaced with **q=(-0.23,0.75)** — a region only the class-0 crescent
  reaches (~85% class 0 → class 0 is the right answer), nearest training labels [1,0,0,0,0], votes
  k1=1/k3=0/k5=0. Both reviewers **PASS** (each re-measured & confirmed truth/votes/timing; 3 MINOR
  polish applied — NB09 ref → module-00 callback, "nothing learned by fitting", Cover&Hart asymptotic
  1-NN qualifier). Rémy validated visually. `common_errors.md` gained a KNN k=1-noise row; `llms.txt`
  regenerated. Commit `feat(01_knn): notebook 01 — predict by the neighbourhood vote`.
- Chapter 01 (k-NN) plan **approved & persisted** (`docs/plans/chapter_01_KNN.md`) — 6 notebooks: vote
  → distance/scale trap → k-dial → estimator/params → demanding case (breast_cancer + the curse) → an
  optional **NB 6 Advanced** (metric geometry L1/L2/L∞ + Mahalanobis/cosine, metric×curse, nested CV,
  and the silhouette≠k-NN clarification — a deliberate, Rémy-approved exception to the 5-ceiling).
  `make_moons` for NB 1–4 (penguins too separable, measured: 0/69 flips), breast_cancer for NB 5; all
  offline. Reviewer-gated (both REVISE→incorporated). `WORKFLOW.md` updated: chapter close now via PR
  (`main` is protected by a global pre-push hook).
- **Chapter 00 (Getting Started) COMPLETE — 11 notebooks, merged to `main` (`--no-ff`).** The on-ramp:
  what ML is → features/feature space → EDA → split & leakage → nearest centroid → accuracy/baseline →
  confusion/precision-recall → scores/ROC/AUC → over/under-fitting → cross-validation → preprocessing &
  leakage. Plus a fetch-and-cache data layer and a "get your data" step in NB 01. Two-reviewer gate +
  Rémy's visual validation throughout.
- NB 11 (preprocessing & leakage) built — standardization paying off NB 05's scale-sensitivity (NC
  boundary rotates ~52.6° in mm coords; CV 0.989→0.9927), one-hot encoding of `island` (by hand +
  `OneHotEncoder` fit-on-train), `ColumnTransformer`+`Pipeline` under CV, and the ESL §7.10.2 leakage
  demo (1000 pure-noise features: select-on-all 0.85 vs select-in-fold 0.57). Reviewer-gated (pedagogy
  PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed the boundary-rotation angle — my coordinate-space error), Rémy validated.
- NB 01 "Getting the data" step added (Phase 2 of the data-layer change): a fetch+cache section
  (intro md + `load_penguins_full()` with visible `logging` + a "Read the output") inserted after
  "Learning from labelled examples"; teaches fetching/caching as a first ML step, then narrows to the
  2-feature binary slice. Reviewer-gated (ml-expert PASS; pedagogy REVISE→fixed: framed the logging,
  explained the repeated cached-read, trimmed the forward-ref roster, first-run note; +`datasets.py`
  `sex` docstring MALE/FEMALE). Rémy validated visually, merged.
- Data-layer refactor (prereq for NB 11): `datasets.py` switched from a committed binary CSV to
  **fetch-and-cache** the full Palmer penguins set (pinned seaborn-data URL →
  `src/ml_course/data/penguins_full.csv`, git-ignored, offline after first run); added
  `load_penguins_full()` (344×7: +island, sex, bill_depth, body_mass, Chinstrap, missing values) +
  `PENGUINS_FULL_*` constants; `load_penguins()` now **derives** the 2-feature binary subset (verified
  byte-identical to the old committed 274-row CSV → NB 01–10 behaviourally unchanged); removed the
  committed `penguins.csv` + the `.gitignore` exception; repurposed `vendor_penguins.py` to warm the
  cache (logs the download). Tests 14 green; all 10 notebooks re-execute; ruff/black clean. Rémy chose
  fetch-and-cache + a visible fetch step in NB 01 (Phase 2 next). Logging used in `datasets.py` (hook).
- NB 10 (validating honestly: cross-validation) built — single notebook (Rémy chose over a 10a/10b
  split), 30 cells; continues NB 09's make_moons + `flexible_boundary`. Arc: parameters vs
  hyperparameters → the validation set → single-split instability (degree 3,3,5,6,3,9) → stratified
  k-fold BY HAND → CV picks degree 3 → by-hand == `cross_val_score` (0.914286, exact) → one honest
  test estimate (0.9111) → tuning-on-test inflation (+0.014 over 100 splits). No new `src/` (reused
  `plot_train_test_curve`; k-fold scheme + inflation bar in-notebook). Reviewer-gated (pedagogy PASS;
  ml-expert REVISE→ stratification-exactness MAJOR + minors fixed), Rémy validated, merged. Alongside:
  NB 01–09 made ruff-clean (option B, `f84eec6`).
- NB 09 (over-/under-fitting, the generalization gap) built — make_moons + polynomial-degree dial
  (linear engine as plumbing), complexity curve U, generalization gap (≠ variance), bias-variance,
  learning curve, optional variance fan; added `viz.plot_train_test_curve` + test. Reviewer-gated
  (pedagogy PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed the "train error always falls" vs measured kink), Rémy
  validated, merged.
- NB 08 (scores, thresholds, ROC & AUC) built — signed-distance score (`s>0` = centroid), threshold
  trade-off, ROC/AUC 0.989, PR curve, two-feature contrast AUC 1.0; added `viz.plot_roc_curve` +
  `plot_score_threshold` + tests. Reviewer-gated (both PASS; 2 minor polish), Rémy validated, merged.
  Closes the evaluation trilogy (06-08).
- NB 07 (confusion matrix, precision & recall) built — bill-only weaker model for real errors, cm
  [[37,1],[2,29]], precision 0.967 / recall 0.935 / F1 0.951, asymmetric costs. Reviewer-gated (both
  PASS; 3 minor polish), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 06 (accuracy + baseline) built — accuracy formalised, DummyClassifier baseline, the accuracy
  paradox on an imbalanced what-if (Dummy 95%/0-of-2 vs centroid 100%/2-of-2), positive = Gentoo.
  Reviewer-gated (both PASS; 3 minor polish), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 05 (first classifier: nearest centroid) built — by-hand fit/predict class, decision boundary
  (extended `plot_decision_boundary` to be pandas-first + label-agnostic, with a test), honest loop
  (100% test vs 55% baseline, by-hand = sklearn). Reviewer-gated (ml-expert REVISE→fixed, pedagogy
  PASS), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 04 (generalize, don't memorize — stratified split + rote-memorizer demo) built, reviewer-gated
  (both PASS; convergent honesty MINOR fixed), Rémy validated, merged.
- NB 03 (look before you model — EDA) built (+ `viz.plot_class_balance` / `plot_feature_histograms`
  + tests), reviewer-gated (both PASS; polish applied), Rémy validated, merged. Also fixed NB 01 c06's
  dangling "fuller dataset" forward-reference (flagged by pedagogy reviewer).
- NB 02 (features, labels, the feature space) built, reviewer-gated (both PASS; 2 minor polish
  applied), Rémy validated visually, committed and merged into `chapter/00_GettingStarted`.
- NB 01 (what is machine learning?) built, reviewer-gated (pedagogy PASS; ml-expert REVISE→fixed:
  corrected the figure reading, softened the line claim, added subset honesty), Rémy validated
  visually, committed and merged into `chapter/00_GettingStarted`.
- Chapter 00 plan approved and persisted; `course_map.md` 00 section rewritten to 11 notebooks.
- Chapter 00 plan reviewer-gated (both REVISE→incorporated).
- Course scaffold + build workflow set up on `main` (3 infra commits).
